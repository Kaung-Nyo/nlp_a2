# nlp_a2

This repository is the fullfilment for the A2 assigment in the coruse of Natural Language Processing at AIT.

A LSTM model is trained on the context of Game of Throne stories to generate next tokens.

The model configuration:

* vocab size - 11506
* embedding size - 1024
* hidden size - 1024
* number of layers - 2
* dropout rate - 0.65

Corpus:

1. A Game of Thrones
2. A Clash of Kings
3. A Storm of Swords

This dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/game-of-thrones-book-dataset.
Then, prepare and upload the files to https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaung-nyo-lwin/game-of-throne-text to train the model.
