Never betray me."""
"""I never would,"" Missandei promised."
"""Look, dawn comes."""
"The sky had turned a cobalt blue from the horizon to the zenith, and behind the line of low hills to the 
east a glow could be seen, pale gold and oyster pink."
"Dany held Missandei's hand as they watched the 
sun come up."
All the grey bricks became red and yellow and blue and green and orange.
"The scarlet 
sands of the fighting pits transformed them into bleeding sores before her eyes."
"Elsewhere the golden 
dome of the Temple of the Graces blazed bright, and bronze stars winked along the walls where the light 
of the rising sun touched the spikes on the helms of the Unsullied."
"On the terrace, a few flies stirred 
sluggishly."
"A bird began to 
chirp in the persimmon tree, and then two more."
"Dany cocked her head to hear their song, but it was not 
long before the sounds of the waking city drowned them out."
The sounds of my city.
"That morning she summoned her captains and commanders to the garden, rather than descending to the 
audience chamber."
"""Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward he gave 
them peace, prosperity, and justice."
But all I have brought to Slaver's Bay is death and ruin.
"I have been 
more khal than queen, smashing and plundering, then moving on."""
"""There is nothing to stay for,"" said Brown Ben Plumm."
"""Your Grace, the slavers brought their doom on themselves,"" said Daario Naharis."
"""You have brought freedom as well,"" Missandei pointed out."
"""Freedom to starve?"""
asked Dany sharply.
"""Freedom to die?"
"Am I a dragon, or a harpy?"""
Am I mad?
Do I have the taint?
"""A dragon,"" Ser Barristan said with certainty."
"""Meereen is not Westeros, Your Grace."""
"""But how can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city?"""
He had no answer to that.
"Dany 
turned away from them, to gaze out over the city once again."
"""My children need time to heal and learn."
My dragons need time to grow and test their wings.
And I need the same.
"I will not let this city go the 
way of Astapor."
"I will not let the harpy of Yunkai chain up those I've freed all over again."""
"She turned 
back to look at their faces."
"""I will not march."""
"""What will you do then, Khaleesi?"""
asked Rakharo.
"""Stay,"" she said."
"""Rule."
"And be a queen."""
"Chapter 72 
JAIME 
Page 648

The king sat at the head of the table, a stack of cushions under his arse, signing each document as it was 
presented to him."
"""Only a few more, Your Grace,"" Ser Kevan Lannister assured him."
"""This is a bill of attainder against 
Lord Edmure Tully, stripping him of Riverrun and all its lands and incomes, for rebelling against his lawful 
king."
"This is a similar attainder, against his uncle Ser Brynden Tully, the Blackfish."""
"Tornmen signed them 
one after the other, dipping the quill carefully and writing his name in a broad childish hand."
"Jaime watched from the foot of the table, thinking of all those lords who aspired to a seat on the king's 
small council."
They can bloody well have mine.
"If this was power, why did it taste like tedium?"
"He did 
not feel especially powerful, watching Tommen dip his quill in the inkpot again."
He felt bored.
And sore.
"Every muscle in his body ached, and his ribs and shoulders were bruised from the battering 
they'd gotten, courtesy of Ser Addam Marbrand."
just thinking of it made him wince.
"He could only hope 
the man would keep his mouth shut."
"Jaime had known Marbrand since he was a boy, serving as a page 
at Casterly Rock; he trusted him as much as he trusted anyone."
"Enough to ask him to take up shields and 
tourney swords."
He had wanted to know if he could fight with his left hand.
And now I do.
"The knowledge was more painful than the beating that Ser Addarn had given him, and 
the beating was so bad he could hardly dress himself this morning."
"If they had been fighting in earnest, 
Jaime would have died two dozen deaths."
"It seemed so simple, changing hands."
It wasn't.
"Every instinct 
he had was wrong."
"He had to think about 
everything, where once he'd just moved."
"And while he was thinking, Marbrand was thumping him."
"His 
left hand couldn't even seem to hold a longsword properly; Ser Addam."
"had disarmed him thrice, sending 
his blade spinning."
"""This grants said lands, incomes, and castle to Ser Emmon Frey and his lady wife, Lady Genna."""
"Ser 
Kevan presented another sheaf of parchments to the king."
Tommen dipped and signed.
"""This is a decree 
of legitimacy for a natural son of Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort."
"And this names Lord Bolton your 
Warden of the North."""
"Tommen dipped, signed, dipped, signed."
"""This grants Ser Rolph Spicer title to the 
castle Castamere and raises him to the rank of lord."""
Tommen scrawled his name.
"I should have gone to Ser Ilyn Payne, Jaime reflected."
"The King's justice was not a friend as Marbrand 
was, and might well have beat him bloody ... but without a tongue, he was not like to boast of it 
afterward."
All it would take would be one chance remark by Ser Addam.
"in his cups, and the whole 
world would soon know how useless he'd become."
Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
"It was a cruel 
jape, that ... though not quite so cruel as the gift his father had sent him."
"""This is your royal pardon for Lord Gawen Westerling, his lady wife, and his daughter Jeyne, welcoming 
them back into the king's peace,"" Ser Kevan said."
"""This is a pardon for Lord Jonos Bracken of Stone 
Hedge."
This is a pardon for Lord Vance.
This for Lord Goodbrook.
"This for Lord Mooton of 
Maidenpool."""
Jaime pushed himself to his feet.
"""You seem to have these matters well in hand, Uncle."
"I shall leave His 
Grace to you."""
"""As you wish."""
Ser Kevan rose as well.
"""Jaime, you should go to your father."
"This breach between you - 
"" 
"" - is his doing."
Nor will he mend it by sending me mocking gifts.
"Tell him that, if you can pry him away 
Page 649

from the Tyrells long enough."""
His uncle looked distressed.
"""The gift was heartfelt."
"We thought that it might encourage you - "" 
"" - to grow a new hand?"""
Jaime turned to Tommen.
"Though he had Joffrey's golden curls and green 
eyes, the new king shared little else with his late brother."
"He inclined to plumpness, his face was pink and 
round, and he even liked to read."
"He is still shy of nine, this son of mine."
The boy is not the man.
"It would 
be seven years before Tommen was ruling in his own right."
"Until then the realm would remain firmly in the 
hands of his lord grandfather."
"""Sire,"" he asked, ""do I have your leave to go?"""
"""As you like, Ser Uncle."""
Tommen looked back to Ser Kevan.
"""Can I seal them now, Great-Uncle?"""
"Pressing his royal seal into the hot wax was his favorite part of being king, so far."
Jaime strode from the council chamber.
"Outside the door he found Ser 
Meryn Trant standing stiff at guard in white scale armor and snowy cloak."
"If this one should learn how 
feeble I am, or Kettleblack or Blount should hear of it ... ""Remain here until His Grace is done,"" he said, 
""then escort him back to Maegor's."""
Trant inclined his head.
"""As you say, my lord."""
The outer ward was crowded and noisy that morning.
"Jaime made for the stables, where a large group 
of men were saddling their horses."
"""Steelshanks!"""
he called.
"""Are you off, then?"""
"""As soon as m'lady is mounted,"" said Steelshanks Walton."
"""My lord of Bolton expects us."
"Here she is 
now."""
A groom led a fine grey mare out the stable door.
"On her back was mounted a skinny hollow-eyed girl 
wrapped in a heavy cloak."
"Grey, it was, like the dress beneath it, and trimmed with white satin."
"The clasp 
that pinned it to her breast was wrought in the shape of a wolf 's head with slitted opal eyes."
"The girl's 
long brown hair blew wild in the wind."
"She had a pretty face, he thought, but her eyes were sad and 
wary."
"When she saw him, she inclined her head."
"""Ser Jaime,"" she said in a thin anxious voice."
"""You are kind to 
see me off."""
Jaime studied her closely.
"""You know me, then?"""
She bit her lip.
"""You may not recall, my lord, as I was littler then ... but I had the honor to meet you at 
Winterfell when King Robert came to visit my father Lord Eddard."""
"She lowered her big brown eyes and 
mumbled, ""I'm Arya Stark."""
"Jaime had never paid much attention to Arya Stark, but it seemed to him that this girl was older."
"""I 
understand you're to be married."""
"""I am to wed Lord Bolton's son, Ramsay."
"He used to be a Snow, but His Grace has made him a Bolton."
They say he's very brave.
"I am so happy."""
Then why do you sound so frightened?
"""I wish you joy, my lady."""
Jaime turned back to Steelshanks.
"""You have the coin you were promised?"""
"Page 650

""Aye, and we've shared it out."
"You have my thanks."""
The northman grinned.
"""A Lannister always pays 
his debts."""
"""Always,"" said Jaime, with a last glance at the girl."
He wondered if there was much resemblance.
"Not 
that it mattered."
The real Arya Stark was buried in some unmarked grave in Flea Bottom in all likelihood.
"With her brothers dead, and both parents, who would dare name this one a fraud?"
"""Good speed,"" he 
told Steelshanks."
"Nage raised his peace banner, and the northmen formed a column as ragged as their fur 
cloaks and trotted out the castle gate."
"The thin girl on the grey mare looked small and forlorn in their 
midst."
"A few of the horses still shied away from the dark splotch on the hard-packed ground where the earth 
had drunk the life's blood of the stableboy Gregor Clegane had killed so clumsily."
"The sight of it made 
Jaime angry all over again."
"He had told his Kingsguard to keep the crowd out of the way, but that oaf 
Ser Boros had let himself be distracted by the duel."
"The fool boy himself shared some of the blame, to be 
sure; the dead Domishman as well."
And Clegane most of all.
"The blow that took the boy's arm off had 
been mischance, but that second cut ... 
Well, Gregor is paying for it now Grand Maester Pycelle was tending to the man's wounds, but the 
howls heard ringing from the maester's chambers suggested that the healing was not going as well as it 
might."
"""The flesh mortifies and the wounds ooze pus,"" Pycelle told the council."
"""Even maggots will not 
touch such foulness."
"His convulsions are so violent that I have had to gag him to prevent him from biting 
off his tongue."
"I have cut away as much tissue as I dare, and treated the rot with boiling wine and bread 
mold, to no avail."
The veins in his arm are turning black.
"When I leeched him, all the leeches died."
"My 
lords, I must know what malignant substance Prince Oberyn used on his spear."
"Let us detain these other 
Domishmen until they are more forthcoming."""
Lord Tywin had refused him.
"""There will be trouble enough with Sunspear over Prince Oberyn's death."
"I 
do not mean to make matters worse by holding his companions captive."""
"""Then I fear Ser Gregor may die."""
"""Undoubtedly."
I swore as much in the letter I sent to Prince Doran with his brother's body.
"But it must 
be seen to be the sword of the King's justice that slays him, not a poisoned spear."
"Heal him."""
Grand Maester Pycelle blinked in dismay.
"""MY lord - 
""Heal him,"" Lord Tywin said again, vexed."
"""You are aware that Lord Varys has sent fishermen into the 
waters around Dragonstone."
They report that only a token force remains to defend the island.
"The Lyseni 
are gone from the bay, and the great part of Lord Stannis's strength with them."""
"""Well and good,"" announced Pycelle."
"""Let Stannis rot in Lys, I say."
"We are well rid of the man and his 
ambitions."""
"""Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard?"
This is Stannis Baratheon.
"The man will 
fight to the bitter end and then some."
"If he is gone, it can only mean he intends to resume the war."
"Most 
likely he will land at Storm's End and try and rouse the storm lords."
"If so, he's finished."
"But a bolder man 
might roll the dice for Dome."
"If he should win Sunspear to his cause, he might prolong this war for years."
"So we will not offend the Martells any further, for any reason."
"The Domishmen are free to go, and you 
will heal Ser Gregor."""
"Page 651

And so the Mountain screamed, day and night."
"Lord Tywin Lannister could cow even the Stranger, it 
would seem."
"As Jaime climbed the winding steps of White Sword Tower, he could hear Ser Boros snoring in his cell."
"Ser Balon's door was shut as well; he 
had the king tonight, and would sleep all day."
"Aside from Blount's snores, the tower was very quiet."
"That 
suited Jaime well enough."
I ought to rest myself.
"Last night, after his dance with Ser Addam, he'd been 
too sore to sleep."
"But when he stepped into his bedchamber, he found his sister waiting for him."
"She stood beside the open window, looking over the curtain walls and out to sea."
"The bay wind swirled 
around her, flattening her gown against her body in a way that quickened Jaime's pulse."
"It was white, that 
gown, like the hangings on the wall and the draperies on his bed."
"Swirls of tiny emeralds brightened the 
ends of her wide sleeves and spiraled down her bodice."
"Larger emeralds were set in the golden 
spiderweb that bound her golden hair."
"The gown was cut low, to bare her shoulders and the tops of her 
breasts."
She is so beautiful.
He wanted nothing more than to take her in his arms.
"""Cersei."""
He closed the door softly.
"""Why are you here?"""
"""Where else could I go?"""
When she turned to him there were tears in her eyes.
"""Father's made it clear 
that I am no longer wanted on the council."
"Jaime, won't you talk to him?"""
Jaime took off his cloak and hung it from a peg on the wall.
"""I talk to Lord Tywin every day."""
"""Must you be so stubborn?"
"All he wants..."" 
""."
.
.
"is to force me from the Kingsguard and send me back to Casterly Rock."""
"""That need not be so terrible."
He is sending me back to Casterly Rock as well.
"He wants me far away, 
so he'll have a free hand with Tommen."
"Tornmen is my son, not his!"""
"""Tommen is the king."""
"""He is a boy!"
A frightened little boy who saw his brother murdered at his own wedding.
"And now they 
are telling him that he must marry."
"The girl is twice his age and twice a widow!"""
"He eased himself into a chair, trying to ignore the ache of bruised muscles."
"""The Tyrells are insisting."
"I 
see no harm in it."
Tommen's been lonely since Myrcella went to Dorne.
"He likes having Margaery and 
her ladies about."
"Let them wed."" 
""He is your son."
.
". """
"""He is my seed."
He's never called me Father.
No more than Joffrey ever did.
"You warned me a 
thousand times never to show any undue interest in them."""
"""To keep them safe!"
You as well.
"How would it have looked if my brother had played the father to the 
king's children?"
"Even Robert might have grown suspicious."""
"""Well, he's beyond suspicion now."""
"Robert's death still left a bitter 
Page 652

taste in Jaime's mouth."
"It should have been me who killed him, not Cersei."
"""I only wished he'd died at my 
hands."""
When I still had two of them.
"""If I'd let kingslaying become a habit, as he liked to say, I could 
have taken you as my wife for all the world to see."
"I'm not ashamed of loving you, only of the things I've 
done to hide it."
That boy at Winterfell .
.
". """
"""Did I tell you to throw him out the window?"
"If you'd gone hunting as I begged you, nothing would have 
happened."
"But no, you had to have me, you could not wait until we returned to the city."""
"""I'd waited long enough."
"I hated watching Robert stumble to your bed every night, always wondering if 
maybe this night he'd decide to claim his rights as husband."""
"Jaime suddenly remembered something else 
that troubled him about Winterfell."
"""At Riverrun, Catelyn Stark seemed convinced I'd sent some footpad 
to slit her son's throat."
"That I'd given him a dagger."""
"""That,"" she said scornfully."
"""Tyrion asked me about that."""
"""There was a dagger."
"The scars on Lady Catelyn's hands were real enough, she showed them to me."
Did you ...
"?"""
"""Oh, don't be absurd."""
Cersei closed the window.
"""Yes, I hoped the boy would die."
So did you.
"Even 
Robert thought that would have been for the best."
"'We kill our horses when they break a leg, and our 
dogs when they go blind, but we are too weak to give the same mercy to crippled children/ he told me."
"He was blind himself at the time, from drink."""
Robert?
"Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups 
that he would have denied angrily the next day."
"""Were you alone when Robert said this?"""
"""You don't think he said it to Ned Stark, I hope?"
Of course we were alone.
"Us and the children."""
"Cersei 
removed her hairnet and draped it over a bedpost, then shook out her golden curls."
"""Perhaps Myrcella 
sent this man with the dagger, do you think so?"""
"it was meant as mockery, but she'd cut right to the heart of it, Jaime saw at once."
"""Not Myrcella."
"Joffrey."""
Cersei frowned.
"""Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to him."
"He was 
only a child himself . """
"""A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father."""
"He had an 
uncomfortable thought."
"""Tyrion almost died because of this bloody dagger."
"If he knew the whole thing 
was Joffrey's work, that might be why..."" 
""I don't care why,"" Cersei said."
"""He can take his reasons down to hell with him."
"If you had seen how Joff 
died ... he fought, Jaime, he fought for every breath, but it was as if some malign spirit had its hands about 
his throat."
He had such terror in his eyes ...
"When he was little, held run to me when he was scared or 
hurt and I would protect him."
"But that 
night there was nothing I could do."
"Tyrion murdered him in front of me, and there was nothing I could 
do."""
Cersei sank to her knees before his chair and took Jaime's good hand between both of hers.
"""Joff is 
dead and Myrcella's in Dome."
Tommen's all I have left.
You mustn't let Father take him from me.
"Jaime, 
please."""
"Page 653

""Lord Tywin has not asked for my approval."
"I can talk to him, but he will not listen..."" 
""He will if you agree to leave the Kingsguard.- 
""I'm not leaving the Kingsguard."""
His sister fought back tears.
"""Jaime, you're my shining knight."
"You cannot abandon me when I need you 
most!"
"He is stealing my son, sending me away ... and unless you stop him, Father is going to force me to 
wed again!"""
"Jaime should not have been surprised, but he was."
"The words were a blow to his gut harder than any 
that Ser Addam Marbrand had dealt him."
"""Who? """
"""Does it matter?"
Some lord or other.
Someone Father thinks he needs.
I don't care.
"I will not have 
another husband."
"You are the only man I want in my bed, ever again."""
"""Then tell him that!"""
She pulled her hands away.
"""You are talking madness again."
"Would you have us ripped apart, as 
Mother did that time she caught us playing?"
"Tommen would lose the throne, Myrcella her marriage ..."
"I 
want to be your wife, we belong to each other, but it can never be, Jaime."
"We are brother and sister."""
"""The Targaryens ."
.
.
"""We are not Targaryens!"""
"""Quiet,"" he said, scornfully."
"""So loud, you'll wake my Sworn Brothers."
"We can't have that, now, can 
we?"
"People might learn that you had come to see me."""
"'Jaime,"" she sobbed, ""don't you think I want it as much as you do?"
"it makes no matter who they wed me 
to, I want you at my side, I want you in my bed, I want you inside me."
Nothing has changed between us.
"Let me prove it to you."""
She pushed up his tunic and began to fumble with the laces of his breeches.
Jaime felt himself responding.
"""No,"" he said, ""not here."""
"They had never done it in White Sword Tower, 
much less in the Lord Commander's chambers."
"""Cersei, this is not the place."""
"""You took me in the sept."
"This is no different."""
She drew out his cock and bent her head over it.
Jaime pushed her away with the stump of his right hand.
"""No."
"Not here, I said."""
"He forced himself to 
stand."
"For an instant he could see confusion in her bright green eyes, and fear 
as well."
Then rage replaced it.
"Cersei gathered herself together, got to her feet, straightened her skirts."
"""Was it your hand they hacked off in Harrenhal, or your manhood?"""
"As she shook her head, her hair 
tumbled around her bare white shoulders."
"""I was a fool to come."
"You lacked the courage to avenge 
Joffrey, why would I think that you'd protect Tommen?"
"Tell me, if the imp had killed all three of your 
children, would that have made you wroth?"""
"""Tyrion is not going to harm Tornmen or Myrcella."
"I am still not certain he killed Joffrey."""
"Page 654

Her mouth twisted in anger."
"""How can you say that?"
"After all his threats - "" 
""Threats mean nothing."
"He swears he did not do it."""
"""Oh, he swears, is that it?"
"And dwarfs don't lie, is that what you think?"""
"""Not to me."
"No more than you would."""
"""You great golden fool."
"He's lied to you a thousand times, and so have L"" She bound up her hair again, 
and scooped up the hairnet from the bedpost where she'd hung it."
"""Think what you will."
"The little monster 
is in a black cell, and soon Ser Ilyn will have his head off."
"Perhaps you'd like it for a keepsake."""
"She 
glanced at the pillow."
"""He can watch over you as you sleep alone in that cold white bed."
"Until his eyes rot 
out, that is."""
"""You had best go, Cersei."
"You're making me angry."""
"""Oh, an angry cripple."
"How terrifying."""
She laughed.
"""A pity Lord Tywin Lannister never had a son."
"I 
could have been the heir he wanted, but I lacked the cock."
"And speaking of such, best tuck yours away, 
brother."
"it looks rather sad and small, hanging from your breeches like that."""
"When she was gone Jaime took her advice, fumbling one-handed at his laces."
"He felt a bone-deep ache 
in his phantom fingers."
"I've lost a hand, a father, a son, a sister, and a lover, and soon enough I will lose a 
brother."
And yet they keep telling me House Lannister won this war.
"Jaime donned his cloak and went downstairs, where he found Ser Boros Blount having a cup of wine in 
the common room."
"""When you're done with your drink, tell Ser Loras I'm ready to see her."""
Ser Boros was too much of a coward to do much more than glower.
"""You are ready to see who?"""
"""Just tell Loras."""
"""Aye."""
Ser Boros drained his cup.
"""Aye, Lord Commander."""
"He took his own good time about it, though, or else the Knight of Flowers proved hard to find."
"Several 
hours had passed by the time they arrived, the slim handsome youth and the big ugly maid."
"Jaime was 
sitting alone in the round room, leafing idly through the White Book."
"""Lord 
Commander,"" Ser Loras said, ""you wished to see the Maid of Tarth?"""
"""I did."""
Jaime waved them closer with his left hand.
"""You have talked with her, I take it?"""
"""As you commanded, my lord."""
"""And?"""
The lad tensed.
"""I ... it may be it happened as she says, ser."
That it was Stannis.
"I cannot be certain."""
"""Varys tells me that the castellan of Storm's End perished strangely as well,"" said Jaime."
"""Ser Cortnay Penrose,"" said Brienne sadly."
"""A good man."""
"Page 655

""A stubborn man."
One day he stood square in the way of the King of Dragonstone.
"The next he leapt 
from a tower."""
Jaime stood.
"""Ser Loras, we will talk more of this later."
"You may leave Brienne with me."""
"The wench looked as ugly and awkward as ever, he decided when Tyrell left them."
"Someone had 
dressed her in woman's clothes again, but this dress fit much better than that hideous pink rag the goat 
had made her wear."
"""Blue is a good color on you, my lady,"" Jaime observed."
"""It goes well with your 
eyes."""
She does have astonishing eyes.
"Brienne glanced down at herself, flustered."
"""Septa Donyse padded out the bodice, to give it that shape."
"She said you sent her to me."""
"She lingered by the door, as if she meant to flee at any second."
"""You look ."
.
". """
"""Different?"""
He managed a half-smile.
"""More meat on the ribs and fewer lice in my hair, that's all."
"The 
stump's the same."
"Close the door and come here."""
She did as he bid her.
"""The white cloak."
.
.
"""."
.
.
"is new, but I'm sure I'll soil it soon enough."""
"""That wasn't ..."
"I was about to say that it becomes you."""
"She came closer, hesitant."
"""Jaime, did you mean what you told Ser Loras?"
"About ... about King Renly, 
and the shadow?"""
Jaime shrugged.
"""I would have killed Renly myself if we'd met in battle, what do I care who cut his 
throat?"""
"""You said I had honor."
.
". """
"""I'm the bloody Kingslayer, remember?"
"When I say you have honor, that's like a whore vouchsafing 
your maidenhood."""
He leaned back and looked up at her.
"""Steelshanks is on his way back north, to 
deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton."""
"""You gave her to him?"""
"she cried, dismayed."
"""You swore an oath to Lady Catelyn ."
.
". """
"""With a sword at my throat, but never mind."
Lady Catelyn's dead.
"I could not give her back her 
daughters even if I had them."
"And the girl my father sent with Steelshanks was not Arya Stark."""
"""Not Arya Stark?"""
"""You heard me."
"My lord father found some skinny northern girl more 
or less the same age with more or less the same coloring."
"He dressed her up in white and grey, gave her 
a silver wolf to pin her cloak, and sent her off to wed Bolton's bastard."""
"He lifted his stump to point at 
her."
"""I wanted to tell you that before you went galloping off to rescue her and got yourself killed for no 
good purpose."
"You're not half bad with a sword, but you're not good enough to take on two hundred 
men by yourself."""
Brienne shook her head.
"""When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid him with false coin..."" 
""Oh, he knows."
"Lannisters lie, remember?"
"It makes no matter, this girl serves his purpose just as well."
"Page 656

Who is going to say that she isn't Arya Stark?"
"Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for her 
sister, who has disappeared."""
"""Why would you tell me all this, if it's true?"
"You are betraying your father's secrets."""
"The Hand's secrets, he thought."
I no longer have a father.
"""l pay my debts like every good little lion."
"I did 
promise Lady Stark her daughters ... and one of them is still alive."
"My brother may know where she is, 
but if so he isn't saying."
"Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped him murder Joffrey."""
The wench's mouth got stubborn.
"""I will not believe that gentle girl a poisoner."
"Lady Catelyn said that 
she had a loving heart."
It was your brother.
"There was a trial, Ser Loras said."""
"""Two trials, actually."
Words and swords both failed him.
A bloody mess.
"Did you watch from your 
window?"""
"""My cell faces the sea."
"I heard the shouting, though."""
"""Prince Oberyn of Dome is dead, Ser Gregor Clegane lies dying, and Tyrion stands condemned before 
the eyes of gods and men."
They're keeping him in a black cell till they kill him.
Brienne looked at him.
"""You do not believe he did it."""
Jaime gave her a hard smile.
"""See, wench?"
We know each other too well.
"Tyrion's wanted to be me 
since he took his first step, but he'd never follow me in kingslaying."
Sansa Stark killed Joffrey.
"My 
brother's kept silent to protect her."
He gets these fits of gallantry from time to time.
"The last one cost him 
a nose."
"This time it will mean his head."""
"""No,"" Brienne said."
"""It was not my lady's daughter."
"It could not have been her."""
"""There's the stubborn stupid wench that I remember."""
She reddened.
"""My name is ."
.

"""Brienne of Tarth."""
Jaime sighed.
"""I have a gift for you."""
"He reached down under the Lord Commander's 
chair and brought it out, wrapped in folds of crimson velvet."
"Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite her, reached out a huge freckled hand, and flipped 
back a fold of cloth."
Rubies glimmered in the light.
"She picked the treasure up gingerly, curled her fingers 
around 
the leather grip, and slowly slid the sword free of its scabbard."
Blood and black the ripples shone.
"A 
finger of reflected light ran red along the edge."
"""Is this Valyrian steel?"
"I have never seen such colors."""
"""Nor I."
There was a time that I would have given my right hand to wield a sword like that.
"Now it 
appears I have, so the blade is wasted on me."
"Take it."""
"Before she could think to refuse, he went on."
"""A 
sword so fine must bear a name."
It would please me if you would call this one Oathkeeper.
"One more 
thing."
"The blade comes with a price."""
Her face darkened.

"Yes, I recall."

Brienne's homely face twisted in fury.
"""If you believe that I would harm my lady's daughter for a sword, 
you - "" 
""fust listen,"" he snapped, angered by her assumption."
"""I want you to find Sansa first, and get her 
somewhere safe."
"How else are the two of us going to make good our stupid vows to your precious dead 
Lady Catelyn?"
The wench blinked.
"""I ..."
"I thought ... "" ""I know what you thought."""
"Suddenly Jaime was sick of the sight 
of her."
She bleats like a bloody sheep.
"""When Ned Stark died, his greatsword was given to the King's 
justice,"" he told her."
"""But my father felt that such a fine blade was wasted on a mere headsman."
"He gave 
Ser Ilyn a new sword, and had Ice melted down and reforged."
"There was enough metal for two new 
blades."
You're holding one.
"So you'll be defending Ned Stark's daughter with Ned Stark's own steel, if 
that makes any difference to you."""
"""Ser, I ..."
I owe you an apolo .

He cut her off.
"""Take the bloody sword and go, before I change my mind."
"There's a bay mare in the 
stables, as homely as you are but somewhat better trained."

ride home to your isle of sapphires, it's naught to me."
"I don't want to look at you anymore."""
"""Jaime ... 
""Kingslayer,"" he reminded her."
"""Best use that sword to clean the wax out of your ears, wench."

done."""
"Stubbornly, she persisted."
"""Joffrey was your."

"""My king."
"Leave it at that."""
"""You say Sansa killed him."
"Why protect her?"""
Because Joff was no more to me than a squirt of seed in Cersei's cunt.
And because he deserved to die.
"""I have made kings and unmade them."
"Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor."""
Jaime smiled thinly.
"""Besides, kingslayers should band together."
"Are you ever going to go?"""
Her big hand wrapped tight around Oathkeeper.
"""I will."
"And I will find 
the girl and keep her safe."
For her lady mother's sake.
"And for yours."""
"She bowed stiffly, whirled, and 
went."
Jaime sat alone at the table while the shadows crept across the room.
"As dusk began to settle, he lit a 
candle and opened the White Book to his own page."
Quill and ink he found in a drawer.
"Beneath the last 
line Ser Barristan had entered, he wrote in an awkward hand that might have done credit to a 
six-year-old being taught his first letters by a maester: 
Defeated in the Whispering Wood by the Young Wolf Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings."
Held captive at Riverrun and ransomed for a promise unfuffilled.
"Captured again by the Brave 
Companions, and maimed at the word of Vargo Hoat their captain, losing his sword hand to the blade of 
Zollo the Fat."
"Returned safely to King's Landing by Brienne, the Maid of Tarth."
"Page 658

When he was done, more than three-quarters of his page still remained to be filled between the gold lion 
on the crimson shield on top and the blank white shield at the bottom."
"Ser Gerold Hightower had begun 
his history, and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it, but the rest Jaime Lannister would need to write for 
himself."
"He could write whatever he chose, henceforth."
"Whatever he chose ... 
Chapter 73 
JON 
The wind was blowing wild from the east, so strong the heavy cage would rock whenever a gust got it in 
its teeth."
"It skirled along the Wall, shivering off the ice, making Jon's cloak flap against the bars."
"The sky 
was slate grey, the sun no more than a faint patch of brightness behind the clouds."
"Across the killing 
ground, he could see the glimmer of a thousand campfires burning, but their lights seemed small and 
powerless against such gloom and cold."
A grim day.
"Jon Snow wrapped gloved hands around the bars and held tight as the wind hammered at 
the cage once more."
"When he looked straight down past his feet, the ground was lost in shadow, as if he 
were being lowered into some bottomless pit."
"Well, death is a bottomless pit of sorts, he reflected, and 
when this day's work is done my name will be shadowed forever."
"Bastard children were born from lust and lies, men said; their nature was wanton and treacherous."
"Once 
Jon had meant to prove them wrong, to show his lord father that he could be as good and true a son as 
Robb."
I made a botch of that.
"Robb had become a hero king; if Jon was remembered at all, it would be 
as a turncloak, an oathbreaker, and a murderer."
"He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see his 
shame."
I should have stayed in that cave with Ygritte.
"if there was a life beyond this one, he hoped to tell her 
that."
"She will claw my face the way the eagle did, and curse me for a coward, but I'll tell her all the same."
"He flexed his sword hand, as Maester Aemon had taught him."
"The habit had become part of him, and he 
would need his fingers to be limber to have even half a chance of murdering Mance Rayder."
"They had pulled him out this morning, after four days in the ice, locked up in a cell five by five by five, 
too low for him to stand, too tight for him to stretch out on his back."
"The stewards had long ago 
discovered that food and meat kept longer in the icy storerooms carved from the base of the Wall ... but 
prisoners did not."
"""You will die in here, Lord Snow,"" Ser Alliser had said just before he closed the heavy 
wooden door, and Jon had believed it."
"But this morning they had come and pulled him out again, and 
marched him cramped and shivering back to the King's Tower, to stand before jowly Janos Slynt once 
more 
""That old maester says I cannot hang you,"" Slynt declared."
"""He has written Cotter Pyke, and even had 
the bloody gall to show me the letter."
"He says you are no tumcloak."""
"""Aemon's lived too long, my lord,"" Ser Alliser assured him."
"""His wits have gone dark as his eyes."""
"Page 659

""Aye,"" Slynt said."
"""A blind man with a chain about his neck, who does he think he is?"""
"Aemon Targaryen, Jon thought, a king's son and a king's brother and a king who might have been."
"But 
he said nothing."
"""Still,"" Slynt said, ""I will not have it said that Janos Slynt hanged a man unjustly."
I will not.
"I have decided 
to give you one last chance to prove you are as loyal as you claim, Lord Snow."
"One last chance to do 
your duty, yes!"""
He stood.
"""Mance Rayder wants to parley with us."
"He knows he has no chance now 
that Janos Slynt has come, so he wants to talk, this King-beyond-the-Wall."
"But the man is craven, and 
will not come to us."
No doubt he knows I'd hang him.
"Hang him by his feet from the top of the Wall, on a 
rope two hundred feet long!"
But he will not come.
"He asks that we send an envoy to him."""
"""We're sending you, Lord Snow."""
Ser Alliser smiled.
"""Me."""
Jon's voice was flat.
"""Why me?"""
"""You rode with these wildlings,"" said Thome."
"""Mance Rayder knows you."
"He will be more inclined to 
trust you."""
That was so wrong Jon might have laughed.
"""You've got it backward."
"Mance suspected me from the 
first."
"If I show up in his camp wearing a black cloak again and speaking for the Night's Watch, he'll know 
that I betrayed him."""
"""He asked for an envoy, we are sending one,"" said Slynt."
"""If you are too craven to face this tumcloak 
king, we can return you to your ice cell."
"This time without the furs, I think."
"Yes."""
"""No need for that, my lord,"" said Ser Alliser."
"""Lord Snow will do as we ask."
"He wants to show us that 
he is no tumcloak."
"He wants to prove himself a loyal man of the Night's Watch."""
"Thome was much the more clever of the two, Jon realized; this had his stink all over it."
He was trapped.
"""I'll go,"" he said in a clipped, curt voice."
"""M'lord, "" Janos Slynt reminded him."
"""You'll address me - "" 
""I'll go, mylord."
"But you are making a mistake, mylord."
"You are sending the wrong man, my lord."
"just 
the sight of me is going to anger Mance."
"My lord would have a better chance of reaching terms if he sent 
- 
""Terms?"""
Ser Alliser chuckled.
"""Janos Slynt does not make terms with lawless savages, Lord Snow."
"No, he does not."""
"""We're not sending you to talk with Mance Rayder,"" Ser Alliser said."
"""We're sending you to kill him."""
"The wind whistled through the bars, and Jon Snow shivered."
"His leg was throbbing, and his head."
"He 
was not fit to kill a kitten, yet here he was."
The trap had teeth.
"With Maester Aemon insisting on Jon's 
innocence, Lord Janos had not dared to leave him in the ice to die."
This was better.
"""Our honor means 
no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe,"" Qhorin Halfhand had said in the Frostfangs."
"He must 
remember that."
"Whether he slew Mance or only tried and failed, the free folk would kill him."
"Even 
desertion was impossible, if he'd been so inclined; to Mance he was a proven liar and betrayer."
"Page 660

When the cage jerked to a halt, Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw's hilt to loosen 
the bastard blade in its scabbard."
"The gate was a few yards to his left, still blocked by the splintered ruins 
of the turtle, the carcass of a mammoth ripening within."
"There were other corpses too, strewn amidst 
broken barrels, hardened pitch, and patches of burnt grass, all shadowed by the Wall."
"Jon had no wish 
to linger here."
"He started walking toward the wildling camp, past the body of a dead giant whose head 
had been crushed by a stone."
A raven was pulling out bits of brain from the giant's shattered skull.
"It 
looked up as he walked by."
"""Snow,"" it screamed at him."
"""Snow, snow"" Then it opened its wings and flew 
away."
No sooner had he started out than a lone rider emerged from the wildling camp and came toward him.
He wondered if Mance was coming out to parley in no-man's-land.
"That might make it easier, though 
nothing will make it easy."
"But as the distance between them diminished Jon saw that the horseman was 
short and broad, with gold rings glinting on thick arms and a white beard spreading out across his 
massive chest."
"""Har!"""
Tormund boomed when they came together.
"""Jon Snow the crow."
"I feared we'd seen the last o' 
you."""
"""I never knew you feared anything, Tormund."""
That made the wildling grin.
"""Well said, lad."
I see your cloak is black.
Mance won't like that.
"If you've 
come to change sides again, best climb back on that Wall o' yours."""
"""They've sent me to treat with the King-beyond-the-Wall."""
"""Treat?"""
Tormund laughed.
"""Now there's a word."
Har!
"Mance wants to talk, that's true enough."
"Can't 
say he'd want to talk with you, though."""
"""I'm the one they've sent."""
"""I see that."
"Best come along, then."
"You want to ride?"""
"""I can walk.,, 
""You fought us hard here."""
Tormund turned his garron back toward the wildling camp.
"""You and your 
brothers."
I give you that.
"Two hundred dead, and a dozen giants."
"Mag himself went in that gate o' yours 
and never did come out."""
"""He died on the sword of a brave man named Donal Noye."""
"""Aye?"
"Some great lord was he, this Donal Noye?"
"One of your shiny knights in their steel smallclothes?"""
"""A blacksmith."
"He only had one arm."""
"""A one-armed smith slew Mag the Mighty?"
Har!
That must o' been a fight to see.
"Mance will make a 
song of it, see if he don't."""
Tormund took a waterskin off his saddle and pulled the cork.
"""This will warm 
us some."
"To Donal Noye, and Mag the Mighty."""
"He took a swig, and handed it down to Jon."
"""To Donal Noye, and Mag the Mighty."""
"The skin was full of mead, but a mead so potent that it made 
Jon's eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through his chest."
"After the ice cell and the cold ride 
down in the cage, the warmth was welcome."
"Page 661

Tormund took the skin back and downed another swig, then wiped his mouth."
"""The Magnar of Therm 
swore t'us that he'd have the gate wide open, so all we'd need to do was stroll through singing."
"He was 
going to bring the whole Wall down."""
"""He brought down part,"" Jon said."
"""On his head."""
"""Har!"""
said Tormund.
"""Well, I never had much use for Styr."
"When a man's got no beard nor hair nor 
ears, you can't get a good grip on him when you fight."""
"He kept his horse at a slow walk so Jon could 
limp beside him."
"""What happened to that leg?"""
"""An arrow."
"One of Ygritte's, I think."""
"""That's a woman for you."
"One day she's kissing you, the next she's filling you with arrows."""
"""She's dead."""
"""Aye?"""
Tormund gave a sad shake of the head.
"""A waste."
"If I'd been ten years younger, I'd have stolen 
her meself."
That hair she had.
"Well, the hottest fires bum out quickest,"" He lifted the skin of mead."
"""To 
Ygritte, kissed by fire!"""
He drank deep.
"""To Ygritte, kissed by fire,"" Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin."
"He drank even 
deeper."
"""Was it you killed her?"""
"""My brother."""
"Jon had never learned which one, and hoped he never would."
"""You bloody crows."""
"Tormund's tone was gruff, yet strangely gentle."
"""That Longspear stole me daughter."
"Munda, me little autumn apple."
"Took her right out o' my tent with all 
four o' her brothers about."
"Toregg slept through it, the great lout, and Torwynd ... well, Torwynd the 
Tame, that says all that needs saying, don't it?"
"The young ones gave the lad a fight, though."""
"""And Munda?"""
asked Jon.
"""She's my own blood,"" said Tormund proudly."
"""She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off, and I 
hear he's got so many scratches on his back he can't wear a cloak."
"She likes him well enough, though."
And why not?
"He don't fight with no spear, you know."
Never has.
"So where do you think he got that 
name?"
"Har!"""
Jon had to laugh.
"Even now, even here."
Ygritte had been fond of Longspear Ryk.
"He hoped he found 
some joy with Tormund's Munda."
Someone needed to find some joy somewhere.
"""You know nothing, Jon Snow,"" Ygritte would have told him."
"I know that I am going to die, he thought."
"I know that much, at least."
"""All men die,"" he could almost hear her say, ""and women too, and every beast 
that flies or swims or runs."
"it's not the when o' dying that matters, it's the how of it, Jon Snow."""
"Easy for 
you to say, he thought back."
"You died brave in battle, storming the castle of a foe."
"I'm going to die a 
turncloak and a killer."
"Nor would his death be quick, unless it came on the end of Mance's sword."
Soon they were among the tents.
"It was the usual wildling camp; a sprawling jumble of cookfires and 
Page 662

piss pits, children and goats wandering freely, sheep bleating among the trees, horse hides pegged up to 
dry."
"There was no plan to it, no order, no defenses."
"But there were men and women and animals 
everywhere."
"Many ignored him, but for every one who went about his business there were ten who stopped to stare; 
children squatting by the fires, old women in dog carts, cave dwellers with painted faces, raiders with 
claws and snakes and severed heads painted on their shields, all turned to have a look."
"Jon saw 
spearwives too, their long hair streaming in the piney wind that sighed between the trees."
"There were no true hills here, but Mance Rayder's white fur tent had been raised on a spot of high stony 
ground right on the edge of the trees."
"The King-beyond-the-Wall was waiting outside, his ragged 
red-and-black cloak blowing in the wind."
"Harma Dogshead was with him, Jon saw, back from her raids 
and feints along the Wall, and Varamyr Sixskins as well, attended by his shadowcat and two lean grey 
wolves."
"When they saw who the Watch had sent, Harma turned her head and spat, and one of Varamyr's 
wolves bared its teeth and growled."
"""You must be very brave or very stupid, Jon Snow,"" Mance Rayder 
said, ""to come back to us wearing a black cloak."""
"""What else would a man of the Night's Watch wear?"""
"""Kill him,"" urged Harma."
"""Send his body back up in that cage o' theirs and tell them to send us someone 
else."
I'll keep his head for my standard.
"A turncloak's worse than a dog."""
"""I warned you he was false."""
"Varamyr's tone was mild, but his shadowcat was staring at Jon hungrily 
through slitted grey eyes."
"""I never did like the smell o' him."""
"""Pull in your claws, beastling."""
Tormund Giantsbane swung down off his horse.
"""The lad's here to hear."
"You lay a paw on him, might be I'll take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting."""
"""Tormund Crowlover,"" Harma sneered."
"""You are a great sack o'wind, old man."""
"The skinchanger was grey-faced, round-shouldered, and bald, a mouse of a man with a wolfling's eyes."
"""Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount him,"" he said in a soft voice."
"""Once a beast's 
been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him."
"Orell was withering inside his 
feathers, so I took the eagle for my own."
"But the joining works both ways, warg."
"Orell lives inside me 
now, whispering how much he hates you."
"And I can soar above the Wall, and see with eagle eyes."""
"""So we know,"" said Mance."
"""We know how few you were, when you stopped the turtle."
"We know how 
many came from Eastwatch."
We know how your supplies have dwindled.
"Pitch, oil, arrows, spears."
"Even your stair is gone, and that cage can only lift so many."
We know.
"And now you know we know."""
He opened the flap of the tent.
"""Come inside."
"The rest of you, wait here."""
"""What, even me?"""
said Tormund.
"""Particularly you."
"Always."""
It was warm within.
"A small fire burned beneath the smoke holes, and a brazier smouldered near the pile 
of furs where Dalla lay, pale and sweating."
Her sister was holding her hand.
"Val, Jon remembered."
"""I was 
sorry when Jarl fell,"" he told her."
"Page 663

Val looked at him with pale grey eyes."
"""He always climbed too fast."""
"She was as fair as he'd 
remembered, slender, full-breasted, graceful even at rest, with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid 
of honey-colored hair that fell to her waist."
"""Dalla's time is near,"" Mance explained."
"""She and Val will stay."
"They know what I mean to say."""
Jon kept his face as still as ice.
Foul enough to slay a man in his own tent under truce.
"Must I murder him 
in front of his wife as their child is being born?"
He closed the fingers of his sword hand.
"Mance was not 
wearing armor, but his own sword was sheathed on his left hip."
"And there were other weapons in the 
tent, daggers and dirks, a bow and a 
quiver of arrows, a bronze-headed spear lying beside that big black ... 
... horn."
Jon sucked in his breath.
"A warhorn, a bloody great warhorn."
"""Yes,"" Mance said."
"""The Horn of Winter, that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth."""
"The horn was huge, eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm 
inside up to the elbow."
"If this came from an aurochs, it was the biggest that ever lived."
"At first he thought 
the bands around it were bronze, but when he moved closer he realized they were gold."
"Old gold, more 
brown than yellow, and graven with runes."
"""Ygritte said you never found the hom."""
"""Did you think only crows could lie?"
"I liked you well enough, for a bastard ... but I never trusted you."
"A 
man needs to earn my trust."""
Jon faced him.
"""If you've had the Hom of Joramun all along, why haven't you used it?"
"Why bother 
building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in our beds?"
"If this hom is all the songs say, why not just 
sound it and be done?"""
"It was Dalla who answered him, Dalla great with child, lying on her pile of furs beside the brazier."
"""We 
free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten."
"Sometimes the short road is not the safest, Jon Snow."
The Homed Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt.
"There is no safe way to grasp it."""
Mance ran a hand along the curve of the great horn.
"""No man goes hunting with only one arrow in his 
quiver,"" he said."
"""I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares, and open the gate 
for us."
I drew your garrison away with feints and raids and secondary attacks.
"Bowen Marsh swallowed 
that lure as I knew he would, but your band of cripples and orphans proved to be more stubborn than 
anticipated."
"Don't think you've stopped us, though."
"The truth is, you are too few and we are too many."
"I 
could continue the attack here and still send ten thousand men to cross the Bay of Seals on rafts and take 
Eastwatch from the rear."
"I could storm the Shadow Tower too, I know the approaches as well as any 
man alive."
"I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles you've abandoned, all of 
them at once."""
"""Why don't you, then?"""
"Jon could have drawn Longclaw then, but he wanted to hear what the wildling 
had to say."
"Page 664

""Blood,"" said Mance Rayder."
"""I'd win in the end, yes, but you'd bleed me, and my people have bled 
enough."""
"""Your losses haven't been that heavy."""
"""Not at your hands."""
Mance studied Jon's face.
"""You saw the Fist of 
the First Men."
You know what happened there.
"You know what we are facing."""
"""The Others ."
.
.
"""They grow stronger as the days grow shorter and the nights colder."
"First they kill you, then they send 
your dead against you."
"The giants have not been able to stand against them, nor the Thenns, the ice river 
clans, the Homfoots."""
"""Nor you?"""
"""Nor me."""
"There was anger in that admission, and bitterness too deep for words."
"""Raymun Redbeard, 
Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Homed Lord, they all came south to conquer, but I've come with 
my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall."""
He touched the hom.
again.
"""If I sound the Hom of 
Winter, the Wall will fall."
Or so the songs would have me believe.
"There are those among my people who 
want nothing more..."" 
""But once the Wall is fallen,"" Dalla said, ""what will stop the Others?"""
Mance gave her a fond smile.
"""It's a wise woman I've found."
"A true queen."""
He turned back to Jon.
"""Go 
back and tell them to open their gate and let us pass."
"If they do, I will give them the hom, and the Wall 
will stand until the end of days."""
Open the gate and let them pass.
"Easy to say, but what must follow?"
"Giants camping in the ruins of 
Winterfell?"
"Cannibals in the wolfswood, chariots sweeping across the barrowlands, free folk stealing the 
daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwives off the Stony Shore?"
"""Are 
you a true king?"""
Jon asked suddenly.
"""I've never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if that's what you're asking,"" 
Mance replied."
"""My birth is as low as a man's can get, no septon's ever smeared my head with oils, I 
don't own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires."
"I am my own 
champion, my own fool, and my own harpist."
"You don't become King-beyond-the-Wall because your 
father was."
"The free folk won't follow a name, and they don't care which brother was bom first."
"They 
follow fighters."
"When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might 
be the stuff of kings."
"Tormund was one, the Magnar another."
"The other three I slew, when they made it 
plain they'd sooner fight than follow."""
"""You can kill your enemies,"" Jon said bluntly, ""but can you rule your friends?"
"If we let your people pass, 
are you strong enough to make them keep the king's peace and obey the laws?"""
"""Whose laws?"
"The laws of Winterfell and King's Landing?"""
Mance laughed.
"""When we want laws we'll 
make our own."
"You can keep your king's justice too, and your king's taxes."
"I'm offering you the hom, not 
our freedom."
"We will not kneel to you."""

""What if we refuse the offer?"""
Jon had no doubt that they would.
"The Old Bear might at least have 
listened, though he would have balked at the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on 
the Seven Kingdoms."
But Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt would dismiss the notion out of hand.
"""If you refuse,"" Mance Rayder said, ""Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days 
hence, at dawn."""
"He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell them of the horn, but if he left Mance still alive 
Lord Janos and Ser Alliser would seize on that as proof that he was a tumcloak."
"A thousand thoughts 
flickered through Jon's head."
"If I can destroy the horn, smash it here and now ... but before he could 
begin to think that through, he heard the low moan of some other horn, made faint by the tent's hide 
walls."
Mance heard it too.
"Frowning, he went to the door."
Jon followed.
The warhom was louder outside.
Its call had stirred the wildling camp.
"Three Homfoot men jogged past, 
carrying long spears."
"Horses were whinnying and snorting, giants roaring in the Old Tongue, and even the 
mammoths were restless."
"""Outrider's horn,"" Tormund told Mance."
"""Something's coming."""
"Varamyr sat crosslegged on the half-frozen ground, his wolves circled restlessly 
around him."
"A shadow swept over him, and Jon looked up to see the eagle's blue-grey wings."
"""Coming, 
from the east."""
"When the dead walk, walls and stakes and swords mean nothing, he remembered."
"You cannot fight the 
dead, Jon Snow No man knows that half so well as me."
Harma scowled.
"""East?"
"The wights should be behind us."""
"""East,"" the skinchanger repeated."
"""Something's coming."""
"""The Others?"""
Jon asked.
Mance shook his head.
"""The Others never come when the sun is up."""
"Chariots were rattling across the 
killing ground, jammed with riders waving spears of sharpened bone."
The king groaned.
"""Where the 
bloody hell do they think they're going?"
"Quenn, get those fools back where they belong."
"Someone bring 
my horse."
"The mare, not the stallion."
"I'll want my armor too."""
Mance glanced suspiciously at the Wall.
"Atop the icy parapets, the straw soldiers stood collecting arrows, but there was no sign of any other 
activity."
"""Harma, mount up your raiders."
"Tormund, find your sons and give me a triple line of spears."""
"""Aye,"" said Tormund, striding off."
"The mousy little skinchanger closed his eyes and said, ""I see them."
"They're coming along the streams and 
game trails..."" 
""Who?"""
"""Men."
Men on horses.
"Men in steel and men in black."""
"""Crows."""
Mance made the word a curse.
He turned on Jon.
"""Did my old brothers think they'd catch me 
with my breeches down if they attacked while we were talking?"""
"Page 666

""If they planned an attack they never told me about it."""
Jon did not believe it.
"Lord Janos lacked the men 
to attack the wildling camp."
"Besides, he was on the wrong side of the Wall, and the gate was sealed with 
rubble."
"He had a different sort of treachery in mind, this can't be his work."
"""If you're lying to me again, you won't be leaving here alive,"" Mance warned."
"His guards brought him his 
horse and armor."
"Elsewhere around the camp, Jon saw people running at cross purposes, some men 
forming up as if to storm the Wall while others slipped into the woods, women driving dog carts east, 
mammoths wandering west."
"He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of 
rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away."
"They wore black mail, black 
halfhelms, and black cloaks."
"Half-armored, Mance drew his sword."
"""You knew nothing of this, did you?"""
"he said to Jon, coldly."
"Slow as honey on a cold morning, the rangers swept down on the wildling camp, picking their way 
through clumps of gorse and stands of trees, over roots and rocks."
"Wildlings flew to meet them, shouting 
war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint, galloping headlong at their ancient 
enemies."
"A shout, a slash, and a fine brave death, Jon had heard brothers say of the free folk's way of 
fighting."
"""Believe what you will,"" Jon told the King-beyond-the-Wall, ""but I knew nothing of any attack."""
"Harma thundered past before Mance could reply, riding at the head of thirty raiders."
"Her standard went 
before her; a dead dog impaled on a spear, raining blood at every stride."
"Mance watched as she 
smashed into the rangers."
"""Might be you're telling it true,"" he said."
"""Those look like Eastwatch men."
Sailors on horses.
Cotter Pyke always had more guts than sense.
"He took the Lord of Bones at Long 
Barrow, he might have thought to do the same with me."
"If so, he's a fool."
"He doesn't have the men, he - "" 
""Mance!"""
the shout came.
"It was a scout, bursting from the trees on a lathered horse."
"""Mance, there's 
more, they're all around us, iron men, iron, a host of iron men."""
"Cursing, Mance swung up into the saddle."
"""Varamyr, stay and see that no harm comes to Dalla."""
"The 
King-beyond-the-Wall pointed his sword at Jon."
"""And keep a few extra eyes on this crow."
"If he runs, rip 
out his throat. """
"""Aye, I'll do that."""
"The skinchanger was a head shorter than Jon, slumped and soft, but that shadowcat 
could disembowel him with one paw."
"""They're coming from the north too,"" Varamyr told Mance."
"""You 
best go."""
Mance donned his helm with its raven wings.
His men were mounted up as well.
"""Arrowhead,"" Mance 
snapped, ""to me, form wedge."""
"Yet when he slammed his heels into the mare and flew across the field at 
the rangers, the men who raced to catch him lost all semblance of formation."
"Jon took a step toward the tent, thinking of the Horn of Winter, but the shadowcat blocked him, tail 
lashing."
"The beast's nostrils flared, and slaver ran from his curved front teeth."
He smells my fear.
"He 
missed Ghost more than ever then."
"The two wolves were behind him, growling."
"""Banners,"" he heard Varamyr murmur, ""I see golden banners, oh ."
.
". """
"A mammoth lumbered by, 
trumpeting, a half-dozen bowmen in the wooden tower on its back."
"""The king ... no..."" 
Then the skinchanger threw back his head and screamed."
"The sound was shocking, ear-piercing, thick with agony."
"Varamyr fell, writhing, and the 'cat was 
Page 667

screaming too ... and high, high in the eastern sky, against the wall of cloud, Jon saw the eagle burning."
"For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star, wreathed in red and gold and orange, its wings beating 
wildly at the air as if it could fly from the pain."
"Higher it flew, and higher, and higher still."
"The scream brought Val out of the tent, white-faced."
"""What is it, what's happened?"""
"Varamyr's wolves 
were fighting each other, and the shadowcat had raced off into the trees, but the man was still twisting on 
the ground."
"""What's wrong with him?"""
"Val demanded, horrified."
"""Where's Mance?"""
"""There."""
Jon pointed.
"""Gone to fight."""
"The king led his ragged wedge into a knot of rangers, his sword 
flashing."
"""Gone?"
"He can't be gone, not now."
"It's started."""
"""The battle?"""
He watched the rangers scatter before Harma's bloody dog's head.
"The raiders screamed 
and hacked and chased the men in black back into the trees."
"But there were more men coming from the 
wood, a column of horse."
"Knights on heavy horse, Jon saw."
"Harma had to regroup and wheel to meet 
them, but half of her men had raced too far ahead."
"""The birth!"""
Val was shouting at him.
"Trumpets were blowing all around, loud and brazen."
"The wildlings have no trumpets, only warhorns."
"They knew that as well as he did; the sound sent free folk running in confusion, some toward the fighting, 
others away."
"A mammoth was stomping through a flock of sheep that three men were trying to herd off 
west."
"The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines, but they were too late, too 
disorganized, too slow."
"The enemy was emerging from the forest, from the east, the northeast, the north; 
three great columns of heavy horse, all dark glinting steel and bright wool surcoats."
"Not the men of 
Eastwatch, those had been no more than a line of scouts."
An army.
The king?
"Jon was as confused as the 
wildlings."
Could Robb have returned?
"Had the 
boy on the iron Throne finally bestirred himself ?"
"""You best get back inside the tent,"" he told Val."
Across the field one column had washed over Harma Dogshead.
"Another smashed into the flank of 
Tormund's spearmen as he and his sons desperately tried to turn them."
"The giants were climbing onto 
their mammoths, though, and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all; he could see how 
the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains."
"But there 
was fear on the wildling side as well, hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle, some 
of them blundering right under the hooves of garrons."
"He saw an old woman's dog cart veer into the path 
of three chariots, to send them crashing into each other."
"""Gods,"" Val whispered, ""gods, why are they doing this?"""
"""Go inside the tent and stay with Dalla."
"It's not safe out here."""
"It wouldn't be a great deal safer inside, but 
she didn't need to hear that."
"""I need to find the midwife,"" Val said."
"""You're the midwife."
"I'll stay here until Mance comes back."""
"He had lost sight of Mance but now he 
found him again, cutting his way through a knot of mounted men."
"The mammoths had shattered the center 
column, but the other two were closing like pincers."
"On the eastern edge of the camps, some archers 
were loosing fire arrows at the tents."
"He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from his saddle and fling him 
forty feet with a flick of its trunk."
"Wildlings streamed past, women and children running from the battle, 
Page 668

some with men hurrying them along."
"A few of them gave Jon dark looks but Longclaw was in his hand, 
and no one troubled him."
"Even Varamyr fled, crawling off on his hands and knees."
"More and more men were pouring from the trees, not only knights now but freeriders and mounted 
bowmen and men-at-arms in jacks and kettle helms, dozens of men, hundreds of men."
"A blaze of 
banners flew above them."
"The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils, but he 
glimpsed a seahorse, a field of birds, a ring of flowers."
"And yellow, so much yellow, yellow banners with 
a red device, whose arms were those?"
"East and north and northeast, he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight, but the attackers rode 
right over them."
"The free folk still had the numbers, but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses."
"in the thickest part of the fray, Jon saw Mance standing tall in his stirrups."
"His red-and-black cloak and 
raven-winged helm made him easy to pick out."
"He had his sword raised and men were rallying to him 
when a wedge of knights smashed into them with lance and sword and longaxe."
"Mance's mare went up 
on her hind legs, kicking, and a spear took her through the breast."
Then the steel tide washed over him.
"It's done, Jon thought, they're breaking."
"The wildlings were running, throwing down their weapons, 
Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and 
Thenns in bronze scales, they were running."
"Mance was gone, someone was waving Harma's head on a 
pole, Tormund's lines had broken."
"Only the giants on their mammoths were holding, hairy islands in a red 
steel sea."
The fires were leaping from tent to tent and some of the tall pines were going up as well.
"And 
through the smoke another wedge of armored riders came, on barded horses."
"Floating above them were 
the largest banners yet, royal standards as big as sheets; a yellow one with long pointed tongues that 
showed a flaming heart, and another like a sheet of beaten gold, with a black stag prancing and rippling in 
the wind."
"Robert, Jon thought for one mad moment, remembering poor Owen, but when the trumpets blew again 
and the knights charged, the name they cried was ""Stannis!"
Stannis!
"STANNIS!"""
"Jon turned away, and went inside the tent."
"Chapter 74 
ARYA 
0utside the inn on a weathered gibbet, a woman's bones were twisting and rattling at every gust of wind."
I know this inn.
"There hadn't been a gibbet outside the door when she had slept here with her sister 
Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane, though."
"""We don't want to go in,"" Arya decided 
suddenly, ""there might be ghosts."""
"""You know how long it's been since I had a cup of wine?"""
Sandor swung down from the saddle.
"""Besides, we need to learn who holds the ruby ford."
"Stay with the horses if you want, it's no hair off my 
arse."""
"""What if they know you?"""
Sandor no longer troubled to hide his face.
"He no longer seemed to care who 
Page 669

knew him."
"""They might want to take you captive."""
"""Let them try."""
"He loosened his longsword in its scabbard, and pushed through the door."
Arya would never have a better chance to escape.
She could ride off on Craven and take Stranger too.
She chewed her lip.
"Then she led the horses to the stables, and went in after him."
They know him.
The silence told her that.
But that wasn't the worst thing.
She knew them too.
"Not the 
skinny innkeep, nor the women, nor the fieldhands by the hearth."
But the others.
The soldiers.
"She knew 
the soldiers."
"""Looking for your brother, Sandor?"""
"Polliver's hand was down the bodice of the girl on his lap, but now 
he slid it out."
"""Looking for a cup of wine."
"Innkeep, a flagon of red."""
Clegane threw a handful of coppers on the floor.
"""I don't want no trouble, ser,"" the innkeep said."
"""Then don't call me ser."""
His mouth twitched.
"""Are you deaf, fool?"
"I ordered wine."""
"As the man ran off, 
Clegane shouted after him, ""Two cups!"
"The girl's thirsty too!"""
"There are only three, Arya thought."
"Polliver gave her a fleeting glance and the boy beside him never 
looked at her at all, but the third one gazed long and hard."
"He was a man of middling height and build, 
with a face so ordinary that it was hard to say how old he was."
The Tickler.
"The Tickler and Polliver 
both."
"The boy was a squire, judging by his age and dress."
"He had a big white pimple on one side of his 
nose, and some red ones on his forehead."
"""is this the lost puppy Ser Gregor spoke of?"""
"he asked the 
Tickler."
"""The one who piddled in the rushes and ran off?"""
"The Tickler put a warning hand on the boy's arm, and gave a short sharp shake of his head."
"Arya read 
that plain enough."
"The squire didn't, or else he didn't care."
"""Ser said his puppy brother tucked his tail between his legs 
when the battle got too warm at King's Landing."
"He said he ran off whimpering."""
"He gave the Hound a 
stupid mocking grin."
Clegane studied the boy and never said a word.
Polliver shoved the girl off his lap and got to his feet.
"""The lad's drunk,"" he said."
"The man-atarms was almost as tall as the Hound, though not so heavily 
muscled."
"A spade-shaped beard covered his jaws and jowls, thick and black and neatly trimmed, but his 
head was more bald than not."
"""He can't hold his wine, is all."""
"""Then he shouldn't drink."""
"""The puppy doesn't scare ."
.
". """
"the boy began, till the Tickler casually twisted his ear between thumb and 
Page 670

forefinger."
The words became a squeal of pain.
The innkeep came scurrying back with two stone cups and a flagon on a pewter platter.
"Sandor lifted 
the flagon to his mouth."
Arya could see the muscles in his neck working as he gulped.
"When he slammed 
it back down on the table, half the wine was gone."
"""Now you can pour."
"Best pick up those coppers too, 
it's the only coin you're like to see today."""
"""We'll pay when we're done drinking,"" said Polliver."
"""When you're done drinking you'll tickle the innkeep to see where he keeps his gold."
"The way you 
always do."""
The innkeep suddenly remembered something in the kitchen.
"The locals were leaving too, and the girls 
were gone."
The only sound in the common room was the faint crackling of the fire in the hearth.
"We 
should go too, Arya knew."
"""If you're looking for Ser, you come too late,"" Polliver said."
"""He was at Harrenhal, but now he's not."
"The 
queen sent for him."""
"He wore three blades on his belt, Arya saw; a longsword on his left hip, and on his 
right 
a dagger and a slimmer blade, too long to be a dirk and too short to be a sword."
"""King Joffrey's dead, 
you know,"" he added."
"""Poisoned at his own wedding feast."""
Arya edged farther into the room.
loffrey's dead.
"She could almost see him, with his blond curls and his 
mean smile and his fat soft lips."
lofftey's dead!
"She knew it ought to make her happy, but somehow she 
still felt empty inside."
"Joffrey was dead, but if Robb was dead too, what did it matter?"
"""So much for my brave brothers of the Kingsguard."""
The Hound gave a snort of contempt.
"""Who killed 
him?"""
"""The Imp, it's thought."
"Him and his little wife."""
"""What wife?"""
"""I forgot, you've been hiding under a rock."
The northern girl.
Winterfell's daughter.
"We heard she killed 
the king with a spell, and afterward changed into a wolf with big leather wings like a bat, and flew out a 
tower window."
"But she left the dwarf behind and Cersei means to have his head."""
"That's stupid, Arya thought."
"Sansa only knows songs, not spells, and she'd never marry the Imp."
The Hound sat on the bench closest the door.
"His mouth twitched, but only the burned side."
"""She ought 
to dip him in wildfire and cook him."
"or tickle him till the moon turns black."""
"He raised his wine cup and 
drained it straightaway."
"He's one of them, Arya thought when she saw that."
She bit her lip so hard she tasted blood.
"He's just 
like they are."
I should kill him when he sleeps.
"""So Gregor took Harrenhal?"""
Sandor said.
"Page 671

""Didn't require much taking,"" said Polliver."
"""The sellswords fled as soon as they knew we were coming, 
all but a few."
"One of the cooks opened a postern gate for us, to get back at Hoat for cutting off his foot."""
He chuckled.
"""We kept him to cook for us, a couple wenches to warm our beds, and put all the rest to 
the sword."""
"""All the rest?"""
Arya blurted out.
"""Well, Ser kept Hoat to pass the time."""
"Sandor said, ""The Blackfish is still in Riverrun?"""
"""Not for long,"" said Polliver."
"""He's under siege."
"Old Frey's going to hang Edmure Tully unless he yields 
the castle."
The only real fighting's around Raventree.
Blackwoods and Brackens.
"The Brackens are ours 
now."""
"The Hound poured a cup of wine for Arya and another for himself, and drank it down while staring at 
the hearthfire."
"""The little bird flew away, did she?"
"Well, bloody good for her."
"She shit on the Imp's head 
and flew off."""
"""They'll find her,"" said Polliver."
"""If it takes half the gold in Casterly Rock."""
"""A pretty girl, I hear,"" said the Tickler."
"""Honey sweet."""
He smacked his lips and smiled.
"""And courteous,"" the Hound agreed."
"""A proper little lady."
"Not like her bloody sister."""
"""They found her too,"" said Polliver."
"""The sister."
"She's for Bolton's bastard, I hear."""
Arya sipped her wine so they could not see her mouth.
"She didn't understand what Polliver was talking 
about."
Sansa has no other sister.
Sandor Clegane laughed aloud.
"""What's so bloody funny?"""
asked Polliver.
The Hound never flicked an eye at Arya.
"""If I'd wanted you to know, I'd have told you."
"Are there ships 
at Saltpans?"""
"""Saltpans?"
How should I know?
"The traders are back at Maidenpool, I heard."
"Randyll Tarly took the 
castle and locked Mooton in a tower cell."
"I haven't heard shit about Saltpans."""
The Tickler leaned forward.
"""Would you put to sea without bidding farewell to your brother?"""
"It gave 
Arya chills to hear him ask a question."
"""Ser would sooner you returned to Harrenhal with us, Sandor."
"I 
bet he would."
Or King's Landing .
.
". """
"""Bugger that."
Bugger him.
"Bugger you."""
"The Tickler shrugged, straightened, and reached a hand behind his head to rub the back of his neck."
"Everything seemed to happen at once then; Sandor lurched to his feet, Polliver drew his longsword, and 
the Tickler's hand whipped around in a blur to send something silver flashing across the common room."
"if 
the Hound had not been moving, the knife might have cored the apple of his throat; instead it only grazed 
his ribs, and wound up quivering in the wall near the door."
"He laughed then, a laugh as cold and hollow 
Page 672

as if it had come from the bottom of a deep well."
"""I was hoping you'd do something stupid."""
"His sword 
slid from its scabbard just in time to knock aside Polliver's first cut."
Arya took a step backward as the long steel song began.
"The Tickler came off the bench with a 
shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other."
"Even the chunky brown-haired squire was up, 
fumbling for his swordhilt."
She snatched her wine cup off the table and threw it at his face.
"Her aim was 
better than it had been at the Twins."
"The cup hit him right on his big white pimple and he went down hard 
on his tail."
"Polliver was a grim, methodical fighter, and he pressed Sandor steadily backward, his heavy longsword 
moving with brutal precision."
"The Hound's own cuts were sloppier, his parries rushed, his feet slow and 
clumsy."
"He's drunk, Arya realized with dismay."
"He drank too much too fast, with no food in his belly."
"And the Tickler was sliding around the 
wall to get behind him."
"She grabbed the second wine cup and flung it at him, but he was quicker than the 
squire had been and ducked his head in time."
The look he gave her then was cold with promise.
"Is there 
gold hidden in the village?"
she could hear him ask.
"The stupid squire was clutching the edge of a table and 
pulling himself to his knees."
Arya could taste the beginnings of panic in the back of her throat.
"Fear cuts 
deeper than swords."
"Fears cuts deeper ... 
Sandor gave a grunt of pain."
"The burned side of his face ran red from temple to cheek, and the stub of 
his ear was gone."
That seemed to make him angry.
"He drove back Polliver with a furious attack, 
hammering at him with the old nicked longsword he had swapped for in the hills."
"The bearded man gave 
way, but none of the cuts so much as touched him."
"And then the Tickler leapt over a bench quick as a 
snake, and slashed at the back of the Hound's neck with the edge of his short sword."
They're killing him.
"Arya had no more cups, but there was something better to throw."
"She drew the 
dagger they'd robbed off the dying archer and tried to fling it at the Tickler the way he'd done."
"It wasn't 
the same as throwing a rock or a crabapple, though."
"The knife wobbled, and hit him in the arm hilt first."
He never even felt it.
He was too intent on Clegane.
"As he stabbed, Clegane twisted violently aside, winning himself half a heartbeat's respite."
"Blood ran 
down his face and from the gash in his neck."
"Both of the Mountain's men came after him hard, Polliver 
hacking at his head and shoulders while the Tickler darted in to stab at back and belly."
"The heavy stone 
flagon was still on the table."
"Arya grabbed it with two hands, but as she lifted it someone grabbed her 
arm."
The flagon slipped from her fingers and crashed to the floor.
"Wrenched around, she found herself 
nose to nose with the squire."
"You stupid, you forgot all about him."
"His big white pimple had burst, she 
saw."
"""Are you the puppy's puppy?"""
"He had his sword in his right hand and her arm in his left, but her own 
hands were free, so she jerked his knife from its sheath and sheathed it again in his belly, twisting."
"He 
wasn't wearing mail or even boiled leather, so it went right in, the same way Needle had when she killed 
the stableboy at King's Landing."
The squire's eyes got big and he let go of her arm.
"Arya spun to the 
door and wrenched the Tickler's knife from the wall."
"Polliver and the Tickler had driven the Hound into a comer behind a bench, and one of them had given 
him an ugly red gash on his upper thigh to go with his other wounds."
"Sandor was leaning against the wall, 
bleeding and breathing noisily."
"He looked as though he could barely stand, let alone fight."
"""Throw down 
the sword, and we'll take you back to Harrenhal,"" Polliver told him."
"Page 673

""So Gregor can finish me himself?"""
"The Tickler said, ""Maybe he'll give you to me."""
"""If you want me, come get me."""
"Sandor pushed away from the wall and stood in a half-crouch behind 
the bench, his sword held across his body."
"""You think we won't?"""
said Polliver.
"""You're drunk."""
"""Might be,"" said the Hound, ""but you're dead."""
"His foot lashed out and caught the bench, driving it hard 
into Polliver's shins."
"Somehow the bearded man kept his feet, but the Hound ducked under his wild slash 
and brought his own sword up in a vicious backhand cut."
Blood spattered on the ceiling and walls.
"The 
blade caught in the middle of Polliver's face, and when the Hound wrenched it loose half his head came 
with it."
The Tickler backed away.
Arya could smell his fear.
"The shortsword in his hand suddenly seemed 
almost a toy against the long blade the Hound was holding, and he wasn't armored either."
"He moved 
swiftly, light on his feet, never taking his eyes off Sandor Clegane."
"it was the easiest thing in the world for 
Arya to step up behind him and stab him."
"""Is there gold hidden in the village?"""
she shouted as she drove the blade up through his back.
"""Is there 
silver?"
"Gems?"""
She stabbed twice more.
"""Is there food?"
"Where is Lord Beric?"""
"She was on top of him 
by then, still stabbing."
"""Where did he go?"
How many men were with him?
How many knights?
"How 
many bowmen?"
"How many, how many, how many, how many, how many, how many?"
"is there gold in 
the village?"""
Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged her off him.
"""Enough,"" was all he said."
"He was 
bleeding like a butchered pig himself, and dragging one leg when he walked."
"""There's one more,"" Arya reminded him."
The squire had pulled the knife out of his belly and was trying to stop the blood with his hands.
"When the 
Hound yanked him upright, he screamed and started to blubber like a baby."
"""Mercy,"" he wept, ""please."
Don't kill me.
"Mother have mercy."""
"""Do I look like your bloody mother?"""
The Hound looked like nothing human.
"""You killed this one too,"" 
he told Arya."
"""Pricked him in his bowels, that's the end of him."
"He'll be a long time dying, though."""
The boy didn't seemed to hear him.
"""I came for the girls,"" he whimpered."

"a maester, take me to a maester, my father's got gold ... 
it was only for the girls ... mercy, ser."""
The Hound gave him a crack across the face that made him scream again.
"""Don't call me ser."""
"He turned 
back to Arya."
"""This one is yours, she-wolf."
"You do it."""
She knew what he meant.
"Arya went to Polliver and knelt in his blood long enough to undo his 
swordbelt."
"Hanging beside his dagger was a slimmer blade, too long to be a dirk, too short to be a man's 
sword ... but it felt just right in her hand."
"Page 674

""You remember where the heart is?"""
the Hound asked.
She nodded.
The squire rolled his eyes.
"""Mercy."""
Needle slipped between his ribs and gave it to him.
"""Good."""
Sandor's voice was thick with pain.
"""If these three were whoring here, Gregor must hold the 
ford as well as Harrenhal."
"More of his pets could ride up any moment, and we've killed enough of the 
bloody buggers for one day."""
"""Where will we go?"""
she asked.
"""Saltpans."""
He put a big hand on her shoulder to keep from falling.
"""Get some wine, she-wolf."
"And take 
whatever coin they have as well, we'll need it."
"If there's ships at Saltpans, we can reach the Vale by sea."""
"His mouth twitched at her, as more blood ran down from where his ear had been."
"""Maybe Lady Lysa 
will marry you to her little Robert."
"There's a match Id like to see."""
"He started to laugh, then groaned 
instead."
"When the time came to leave, he needed Arya's help to get back up on Stranger."
"He had tied a strip of 
cloth about his neck and another around his thigh, and taken the squire's cloak off its peg by the door."
"The cloak was green, with a green arrow on a white bend, but when the Hound wadded it up and 
pressed it to his ear it soon turned red."
"Arya was afraid he would collapse the moment they set out, but 
somehow he stayed in the saddle."
"They could not risk meeting whoever held the ruby ford, so instead of following the kingsroad they 
angled south by east, through weedy fields, woods, and marshes."
"It was hours before they reached the 
banks of the Trident."
"The river had returned meekly to its accustomed channel, Arya saw, all its wet 
brown rage vanished with the rains."
"It's tired too, she thought."
"Close by the water's edge, they found some willows rising from a jumble of weathered rocks."
"Together 
the rocks and trees formed a sort of natural fort where they could hide from both river and trail."
"""Here 
will do,"" the Hound said."
"""Water the horses and gather some deadwood for a fire."""
"When he dismounted, 
he had to catch himself on a tree limb to keep from falling."
"""Won't the smoke be seen?"""
"""Anyone wants to find us, all they need to do is follow my blood."
Water and wood.
"But bring me that 
wineskin first."""
"When he got the fire going, Sandor propped up his helm in the flames, emptied half the wineskin into it, 
and collapsed back against a jut of moss-covered stone as if he never meant to rise again."
"He made Arya 
wash out the squire's cloak and cut it into strips."
Those went into his helm as well.
"""If I had more wine, Id 
drink till I was dead to the world."
"Maybe I ought to send you back to that bloody inn for another skin or 
three. """
"""No,"" Arya said."
"He wouldn't, would he?"
"If he does, I'll just leave him and ride off."
Sandor laughed at the fear on her face.
"""A jest, wolf girl."
A bloody jest.
"Find me a stick, about so long 
Page 675

and not too big around."
And wash the mud off it.
"I hate the taste of mud."""
He didn't like the first two sticks she brought him.
"By the time she found one that suited him, the flames 
had scorched his dog's snout black all the way to the eyes."
Inside the wine was boiling madly.
"""Get the 
cup from my bedroll and dip it half full,"" he told her."
"""Be careful."
"You knock the damn thing over, I will 
send you back for more."
Take the wine and pour it on my wounds.
"Think you can do that?"""
"Arya 
nodded."
"""Then what are you waiting for?"""
he growled.
"Her knuckles brushed the steel the first time she filled the cup, burning her so badly she got blisters."
"Arya 
had to bite her lip to keep from screaming."
"The Hound used the stick for the same purpose, clamping it 
between his teeth as she poured."
"She did the gash in his thigh first, then the shallower cut on the back of 
his neck."
Sandor coiled his right hand into a fist and beat against the ground when she did his leg.
"When it 
came to his neck, he bit the stick so hard it broke, and she had to find him a new one."
"She could see the 
terror in his eyes."
"""Turn your head."""
"She trickled the wine down over the raw red flesh where his ear had 
been, and fingers of brown blood and red wine crept over his jaw."
"He did scream then, despite the stick."
Then he passed out from the pain.
Arya figured the rest out by herself.
"She fished the strips they'd made of the squire's cloak out of the 
bottom of the helm and used them to bind the cuts."
"When she came to his ear, she had to wrap up half 
his head to stop the bleeding."
By then dusk was settling over the Trident.
"She let the horses graze, then 
hobbled them for the night and made herself as comfortable as she could in a niche between two rocks."
The fire burned a while and died.
Arya watched the moon through the branches overhead.
"""Ser Gregor the Mountain,"" she said softly."
"""Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen 
Cersei."""
It made her feel queer to leave out Polliver and the Tickler.
And Joffrey too.
"She was glad he 
was dead, but she wished she could have been there to see him die, or maybe kill him herself."
"Polliver 
said that Sansa killed him, and the Imp."
Could that be true?
"The Imp was a Lannister, and Sansa ..."
"I 
wish I could change into a wolf and grow wings and fly away."
"If Sansa was gone too, there were no more Starks but her."
"Jon was on the Wall a thousand leagues 
away, but he was a Snow, and these different aunts and uncles the Hound wanted to sell her to, they 
weren't Starks either."
They weren't wolves.
"Sandor moaned, and she rolled onto her side to look at him."
"She had left his name out too, she realized."
Why had she done that?
"She tried to 
think of Mycah, but it was hard to remember what he'd looked like."
She hadn't known him long.
"All he 
ever did was play at swords with me."
"""The Hound,"" she whispered, and, ""Valar morghulis."""
"Maybe he'd 
be dead by morning ..."
"But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees, it was him who woke her with the toe of 
his boot."
"She had dreamed she was a wolf again, chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a pack behind 
her, but his foot brought her back just as they were closing for the kill."
"The Hound was still weak, every movement slow and clumsy."
"He slumped in the saddle, and sweated, 
and his ear began to bleed through the bandage."
"He needed all his strength just to keep from falling off 
Stranger."
"Had the Mountain's men come hunting them, she doubted if he would even be able to lift a 
sword."
"Arya glanced over her shoulder, but there was nothing behind them but a crow flitting from tree to 
tree."
The only sound was the river.
"Page 676

Long before noon, Sandor Clegane was reeling."
"There were hours of daylight still remaining when he 
called a halt."
"""I need to rest,"" was all he said."
This time when he dismounted he did fall.
"Instead of trying 
to get back up he crawled weakly under a tree, and leaned up against the trunk."
"""Bloody hell,"" he cursed."
"""Bloody hell."""
"When he saw Arya staring at him, he said, ""I'd skin you alive for a cup of wine, girl."""
She brought him water instead.
"He drank a little of it, complained that it tasted of mud, and slid into a 
noisy fevered sleep."
"When she touched him, his skin was burning up."
"Arya sniffed at his bandages the 
way Maester Luwin had done sometimes when treating her cut or scrape."
"His face had bled the worst, 
but it was the wound on his thigh that smelled funny to her."
"She wondered how far this Saltpans was, and whether she could find it by herself."
"I wouldn't have to kill 
him."
"If I just rode off and left him, he'd die all by himself."
"He'll die of fever, and lie there beneath that tree 
until the end of days."
But maybe it would be better if she killed him herself.
"She had killed the squire at 
the inn and he hadn't done anything except grab her arm."
The Hound had killed Mycah.
"Mycah and 
more."
I bet he's killed a hundred Mycahs.
"He probably would have killed her too, if not for the ransom."
Needle glinted as she drew it.
"Polliver had kept it nice and sharp, at least."
"She turned her body sideways 
in a water dancer's stance without even thinking about it."
Dead leaves crunched beneath her feet.
"Quick 
as a snake, she thought."
Smooth as summer silk.
His eyes opened.
"""You remember where the heart is?"""
he asked in a hoarse whisper.
As still as stone she stood.
"""I ..."
"I was only..."" 
""Don't lie,"" he growled."
"""I hate liars."
I hate gutless frauds even worse.
"Go on, do it."""
"When Arya did not move, he said, ""I killed your butcher's boy."
"I cut him near in half, and 
laughed about it after."""
"He made a queer sound, and it took her a moment to realize he was sobbing."
"""And the little bird, your pretty sister, I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her."
"I took the 
bloody song, she never gave it."
I meant to take her too.
I should have.
"I should have fucked her bloody 
and ripped her heart out before leaving her for that dwarf."""
A spasm of pain twisted his face.
"""Do you 
mean to make me beg, bitch?"
Do it!
"The gift of mercy ... avenge your little Michael..."" 
""Mycah."""
Arya stepped away from him.
"""You don't deserve the gift of mercy."""
The Hound watched her saddle Craven through eyes bright with fever.
"Not once did he attempt to rise 
and stop her."
"But when she mounted, he said, ""A real wolf would finish a wounded animal."""
"Maybe some real wolves will find you, Arya thought."
Maybe they'll smell you when the sun goes down.
Then he would learn what wolves did to dogs.
"""You shouldn't have hit me with an axe,"" she said."
"""You 
should have saved my mother."""
"She turned her horse and rode away from him, and never looked back 
once."
"On a bright morning six days later, she came to a place where the Trident began to widen out and the air 
smelled more of salt than trees."
"She stayed close to the water, passing fields and farms, and a little after 
midday a town appeared before her."
"Saltpans, she hoped."
"A small castle dominated the town; no more 
than a holdfast, really, a single tall square keep with a bailey and a curtain wall."
"Most of the shops and 
inns and alehouses around the harbor had been plundered or burned, though some looked still inhabited."
"Page 677

But the port was there, and eastward spread the Bay of Crabs, its waters shimmering blue and green in 
the sun."
And there were ships.
"Three, thought Arya, there are three."
"Two were only river galleys, shallow draft boats made to ply the 
waters of the Trident."
"The third was bigger, a salt sea trader with two banks of oars, a gilded prow, and 
three tall masts with furled purple sails."
Her hull was painted purple too.
"Arya rode Craven down to the 
docks to get a better look."
"Strangers are not so strange in a port as they are in little villages, and no one 
seemed to care who she was or why she was here."
I need silver.
The realization made her bite her lip.
"They had found a stag and a dozen coppers on 
Polliver, eight silvers on the pimply squire she'd killed, and only a couple of pennies in the Tickler's purse."
"But the Hound had told her to pull off his boots and slice open his blood-drenched clothes, and she'd 
turned up a stag in each toe, and three golden dragons sewn in the lining of his jerkin."
"Sandor had kept it 
all, though."
That wasn't fair.
It was mine as much as his.
"If she had given him the gift of 
mercy ... she hadn't, though."
"She couldn't go back, no more than she could beg for help."
"Begging for 
help never gets you any."
"She would have to sell Craven, and hope she brought enough."
"The stable had been bumt, she learned from a boy by the docks, but the woman who'd owned it was 
still trading behind the sept. Arya found her easily; a big, robust woman with a good horsey smell to her."
"She liked Craven at first look, asked Arya how she'd come by her, and grinned at her answer."
"""She's a 
well-bred horse, that's plain enough, and I don't doubt she belonged to a knight, sweetling,"" she said."
"""But the knight wasn't no dead brother o' yours."
"I been dealing with the castle there many a year, so I 
know what gentleborn folk is like."
"This mare is well-bred, but you're not."""
"She poked a finger at Arya's 
chest."
"""Found her or stole her, never mind which, that's how it was."
"Only way a scruffy little thing like you 
comes to ride a palfrey."""
Arya bit her lip.
"""Does that mean you won't buy her?"""
The woman chuckled.
"""It means you'll take what I give you, sweetling."
"Else we go down to the castle, 
and maybe you get nothing."
"Or even hanged, for stealing some good knight's horse."""
"A half-dozen other Saltpans folks were around, going about their business, so Arya knew she couldn't 
kill the woman."
Instead she had to bite her lip and let herself be cheated.
"The purse she got was pitifully 
flat, and when she asked for more for the saddle and bridle and blanket, the woman just laughed at her."
"She would never have cheated the Hound, she thought during the long walk back to the docks."
"The 
distance seemed to have grown by miles since she'd ridden it."
The purple galley was still there.
"If the ship had sailed while she was being robbed, that would have been 
too much to bear."
A cask of mead was being rolled up the plank when she arrived.
"When she tried to 
follow, a sailor up on deck shouted down at her in a tongue she did not know."
"""I want to see the 
captain,"" Arya told him."
He only shouted louder.
"But the commotion drew the attention of a stout 
grey-haired man in a coat of purple wool, and he spoke the Common Tongue."
"""I am captain here,"" he 
said."
"""What is your wish?"
"Be quick, child, we have a tide to catch."""
"""I want to go north, to the Wall."
"Here, I can pay."""
She gave him the purse.
"""The Night's Watch has a 
Page 678

castle on the sea."""
"""Eastwatch."""
The captain spilled out the silver onto his palm and frowned.
"""Is this all you have?"""
"It is not enough, Arya knew without being told."
She could see it on his face.
"""I wouldn't need a cabin or 
anything,"" she said."
"""I could sleep down in the hold, or..."" 
""Take her on as cabin girl,"" said a passing oarsman, a bolt of wool over one shoulder."
"""She can sleep 
with me."""
"""Mind your tongue,"" the captain snapped."
"""I could work,"" said Arya."
"""I could scrub the decks."
I scrubbed a castle steps once.
Or I could row.
.
". """
"""No,"" he said, ""you couldn't."""
He gave her back her coins.
"""It would make no difference if you could, 
child."
The north has nothing for us.
Ice and war and pirates.
"We saw a dozen pirate ships making north 
as we rounded Crackclaw Point, and I have no wish to meet them again."
"From here we bend our oars 
for home, and I suggest you do the same."""
"I have no home, Arya thought."
I have no pack.
And now I don't even have a horse.
"The captain was turning away when she said, ""What ship is this, my lord? """
He paused long enough to give her a weary smile.
"""This is the galleas Titan's Daughter, of the Free City 
of Braavos."""
"""Wait,"" Arya said suddenly."
"""I have something else."""
"She had stuffed it down inside her smallclothes to 
keep it safe, so she had to dig deep to find it, while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered with 
obvious impatience."
"""One more silver will make no difference, child,"" he finally said."
"""It's not silver."""
Her fingers closed on it.
"""It's iron."
"Here."""
"She pressed it into his hand, the small black 
iron coin that jaqen Hghar had given her, so worn the man whose head it bore had no features."
"It's 
probably worthless, but ..."
"The captain turned it over and blinked at it, then looked at her again."
"""This ... how ..."
"?"""
jaqen said to say the words too.
Arya crossed her arms against her chest.
"""Valar morghulis,"" she said, as 
loud as if she'd known what it meant."
"""Valar dohaeris,"" he replied, touching his brow with two fingers."
"""Of course you shall have a cabin."""
"Chapter 75 
SAMWELL 
Page 679

""He sucks harder than mine."""
Gilly stroked the babe's head as she held him to her nipple.
"""He's hungry,"" said the blonde woman Val, the one the black brothers called the wildling princess."
"""He's 
lived on goats' milk up to now, and potions from that blind maester."""
"The boy did not have a name yet, no more than Gilly's did."
That was the wildling way.
"Not even Mance 
Rayder's son would get a name till his third year, it would seem, though Sam had heard the brothers 
calling him ""the little prince"" and ""bom-in-battle."""
"He watched the child nurse at Gilly's breast, and then he watched Jon watch."
fon is smiling.
"A sad smile, 
still, but definitely a smile of sorts."
Sam was glad to see it.
"It is the first time I've seen him smile since I got 
back."
"They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake, and from Deep Lake to Queensgate, following a 
narrow track from one castle to the next, never out of sight of the Wall."
"A day and a half from Castle 
Black, as they trudged along on callused feet, Gilly heard horses behind them, and turned to see a column 
of black riders coming from the west."
"""My brothers,"" Sam assured her."
"""No one uses this road but the 
Night's Watch."""
"It had turned out to be Ser Denys Mallister from the Shadow Tower, along with the 
wounded Bowen Marsh and the survivors from the fight at the Bridge of Skulls."
"When Sam saw Dywen, 
Giant, and Dolorous Edd Tollett, he broke down and wept."
It was from them that he learned about the battle beneath the Wall.
"""Stannis landed his knights at 
Eastwatch, and Cotter Pyke led him along 
the ranger's roads, to take the wildlings unawares,"" Giant told him."
"""He smashed them."
"Mance Rayder 
was taken captive, a thousand of his best slain, including Harma Dogshead."
"The rest scattered like leaves 
before a storm, we heard."""
"The gods are good, Sam thought."
"If he had not gotten lost as he made his 
way south from Craster's Keep, he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle ... or into Mance 
Rayder's camp, at the very least."
"That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy, but not for him."
Sam had heard all the stories about what wildlings did with captured crows.
He shuddered.
"Nothing that his brothers told him prepared him for what he found at Castle Black, however."
"The 
common hall had burned to the ground and the great wooden stair was a mound of broken ice and 
scorched timbers."
"Donal Noye was dead, along with Rast, Deaf Dick, Red Alyn, and so many more, yet 
the castle was more crowded than Sam had ever seen; not with black brothers, but with the king's 
soldiers, more than a thousand of them."
"There was a king in the King's Tower for the first time in living 
memory, and banners flew from the Lance, Hardin's Tower, the Grey Keep, the Shieldhall, and other 
buildings that had stood empty and abandoned for long years."
"""The big one, the gold with the black stag, 
that's the royal standard of House Baratheon,"" he told Gilly, who had never seen banners before."
"""The 
fox-and-flowers is House Florent."
"The turtle is Estermont, the swordfish is Bar Emmon, and the crossed 
trumpets are for Wensington."""
"""They're all bright as flowers."""
Gilly pointed.
"""I like those yellow ones, with the fire."
"Look, and some of 
the fighters have the same thing on their blouses."""
"""A fiery heart."
"I don't know whose sigil that is."""
He found out soon enough.
"""Queen's men,"" Pyp told him - after he let out a whoop, and shouted, ""Run 
and bar the doors, lads, it's Sam the Slayer come back from the grave,"" while Grenn was hugging Sam so 
hard he thought his ribs might break - ""but best you don't go asking where the queen is."
"Stannis left her at 
Eastwatch, with their daughter and his fleet."
"He brought no woman but the red one."""
"Page 680

""The red one?"""
said Sam uncertainly.
"""Melisandre of Asshai,"" said Grenn."
"""The king's sorceress."
"They say she burned a man alive at 
Dragonstone so Stannis would have favorable winds for his voyage north."
"She rode beside him in the 
battle too, and gave him his magic sword."
"Lightbringer, they call it."
Wait till you see it.
"It glows like it had 
a piece of sun inside it."""
He looked at Sam again and grinned a big helpless stupid grin.
"""I still can't 
believe you're here."""
"Jon Snow had smiled to see him too, but it was a tired smile, like the one he wore now."
"""You made it 
back after all,"" he said."
"""And brought Gilly out as well."
"You've done well, Sam."""
"Jon had done more than well himself, to hear Grenn tell it."
"Yet even capturing the Horn of Winter and a 
wildling prince had not been enough for Ser Alliser Thorne and his friends, who still named him turncloak."
"Though Maester Aemon said his wound was healing well, Jon bore other scars, deeper than the ones 
around his eye."
"He grieves for his wildling girl, and for his brothers."
"""It's strange,"" he said to Sam."
"""Craster had no love for Mance, nor Mance for Craster, but now 
Craster's daughter is feeding Mance's son."""
"""I have the milk,"" Gilly said, her voice soft and shy."
"""Mine takes only a little."
"He's not so greedy as this 
one."""
The wildling woman Val turned to face them.
"""I've heard the queen's men saying that the red woman 
means to give Mance to the fire, as soon as he is strong enough."""
Jon gave her a weary look.
"""Mance is a 
deserter from the Night's Watch."
The penalty for that is death.
"if the Watch had taken him, he would 
have been hanged by now, but he's the king's captive, and no one knows the king's mind but the red 
woman."""
"""I want to see him,"" Val said."
"""I want to show him his son."
"He deserves that much, before you kill him."""
Sam tried to explain.
"""No one is permitted to see him but Maester Aemon, my lady."""
"""If it were in my power, Mance could hold his son."""
Jon's smile was gone.
"""I'm sorry, Val."""
"He turned 
away."
"""Sam and I have duties to return to."
"Well, Sam does, anyway."
We'll ask about your seeing Mance.
"That's all I can promise."""
Sam lingered long enough to give Gilly's hand a squeeze and promise to return again after supper.
"Then 
he hurried after."
"There were guards outside the door, queen's men with spears."
"Jon was halfway down 
the steps, but he waited when he heard Sam puffing after him."
"""You're more than fond of Gilly, aren't 
you?"""
Sam reddened.
"""Gilly's good."
"She's good and kind."""
"He was glad that his long nightmare was done, glad 
to be back with his brothers at Castle Black ... but some nights, alone in his cell, he thought of how warm 
Gilly had been when they'd curled up beneath the furs with the babe between them."
"""She ... she made me 
braver, Jon."
"Not brave, but ..."
"braver."""
"""You know you cannot keep her,"" Jon said gently, ""no more than I could stay with Ygritte."
"You said the 
words, Sam, the same as I did."
"The same as all of us."""
"""I know."
"Gilly said she'd be a wife to me, but ..."
"I told her about the words, and what they meant."
"I don't 
Page 681

know if that made her sad or glad, but I told her."""
"He swallowed nervously and said, ""Jon, could there be 
honor in a lie, if it were told for a ... a good purpose?"""
"""It would depend on the lie and the purpose, I suppose."""
Jon looked at Sam.
"""I wouldn't advise it."
"You're not made to lie, Sam."
"You blush and squeak and stammer."""
"""I do,"" said Sam, ""but I could lie in a letter."
I'm better with a quill in hand.
I had a ... a thought.
"When 
things are more settled here, I thought maybe the best thing for Gilly ..."
"I thought I might send her to Horn 
Hill."
To my mother and sisters and my ... my f-f-father.
"If Gilly were to say the babe was m-mine..."" He 
was blushing again."
"""My mother would want him, I know."
"She would find some place for Gilly, some 
kind of service, it wouldn't be as hard as serving Craster."
"And Lord R-Randyll, he ... he would never say 
so, but he might be pleased to believe I got a bastard on some wildling girl."
"At least it would prove I was 
man enough to lie with a woman and father a child."
"He told me once that I was sure to die a maiden, that 
no woman would ever ... you know ... Jon, if I did this, wrote this lie ... would that be a good thing?"
"The 
life the boy would have ."
.
". """
"""Growing up a bastard in his grandfather's castle?"""
Jon shrugged.
"""That depends in great part on your 
father, and what sort of boy this is."
If he takes after you.
.
". """
"""He won't."
Craster's his real father.
"You saw him, he was hard as an old tree stump, and Gilly is stronger 
than she looks."""
"""If the boy shows any skill with sword or lance, he should have a place with your father's household 
guard at the least,"" Jon said."
"""It's not unknown for bastards to be trained as squires and raised to 
knighthood."
But you'd best be sure Gilly can play this game convincingly.
"From what you've told me of 
Lord Randyll, I doubt he would take kindly to being deceived."""
More guards were posted on the steps outside the tower.
"These were king's men, though; Sam had 
quickly learned the difference."
"The king's men were as earthy and impious as any other soldiers, but the 
queen's men were fervid in their devotion to Melisandre of Asshai and her Lord of Light."
"""Are you going 
to the practice yard again?"""
Sam asked as they crossed the yard.
"""Is it wise to train so hard before your 
leg's done healing?"""
Jon shrugged.
"""What else is there for me to do?"
"Marsh has removed me from duty, for fear that I'm still 
a turncloak."""
"""It's only a few who believe that,"" Sam assured him."
"""Ser Alliser and his friends."
"Most of the brothers 
know better."
"King Stannis knows as well, I'll wager."
"You brought him the Horn of Winter and captured 
Mance Rayder's son."""
"""All I did was protect Val and the babe against looters when the wildlings fled, and keep them there until 
the rangers found us."
I never captured anyone.
"King Stannis keeps his men well in hand, that's plain."
"He 
lets 
them plunder some, but I've only heard of three wildling women being raped, and the men who did it 
have all been gelded."
I suppose I should have been killing the free folk as they ran.
"Ser Alliser has been 
putting it about that the only time I bared my sword was to defend our foes."
"I failed to kill Mance Rayder 
because I was in league with him, he says."""
"Page 682

""That's only Ser Alliser,"" said Sam."
"""Everyone knows the sort of man he is."""
"With his noble birth, his 
knighthood, and his long years in the Watch, Ser Alliser Thorne might have been a strong challenger for 
the Lord Commander's title, but almost all the men he'd trained during his years as master-at-arms 
despised him."
"His name had been offered, of course, but after running a weak sixth on the first day and 
actually losing votes on the second, Thorne had withdrawn to support Lord Janos Slynt."
"""What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble line, and trueborn, while I'm the 
bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand and bedded with a spearwife."
"The warg, I've heard them call me."
"How can I be a warg without a wolf, I ask you?"""
His mouth twisted.
"""I don't even dream of Ghost 
anymore."
"All my dreams are of the crypts, of the stone kings on their thrones."
"Sometimes I hear Robb's 
voice, and my father's, as if they were at a feast."
"But there's a wall between us, and I know that no place 
has been set for me."""
The living have no place at the feasts of the dead.
It tore the heart from Sam to hold his silence then.
"Bran's not dead, Ion, he wanted to stay."
"He's with friends, and they're going north on a giant elk to find a 
three-eyed crow in the depths of the haunted forest."
"it sounded so mad that there were times Sam Tarly 
thought he must have dreamt it all, conjured it whole from fever and fear and hunger ... but he would have 
blurted it out anyway, if he had not given his word."
"Three times he had sworn to keep the secret; once to Bran himself, once to that strange boy Jojen Reed, 
and last of all to Coldhands."
"""The world believes the boy is dead,"" his rescuer had said as they parted."
"""Let his bones lie undisturbed."
We want no seekers coming after us.
"Swear it, Samwell of the Night's 
Watch."
"Swear it for the life you owe me."""
"Miserable, Sam shifted his weight and said, ""Lord Janos will never be chosen Lord Commander."""
"It was 
the best comfort he had to offer Jon, the only comfort."
"""That won't happen."""
"""Sam, you're a sweet fool."
Open your eyes.
"It's been happening for days."""
"Jon pushed his hair back out 
of his eyes and said, ""I may know nothing, but I know that."
"Now pray excuse me, I need to hit someone 
very hard with a sword."""
There was naught that Sam could do but watch him stride off toward the armory and the practice yard.
That was where Jon Snow spent most of his waking hours.
"With Ser Endrew dead and Ser Alliser 
disinterested, 
Castle Black had no master-at-arms, so Jon had taken it on himself to work with some of the rawer 
recruits; Satin, Horse, Hop-Robin with his clubfoot, Arron and Emrick."
"And when they had duties, he 
would train alone for hours with sword and shield and spear, or match himself against anyone who cared 
to take him on."
"Sam, you're a sweet fool, he could hear Jon saying, all the way back to the maester's keep."
"Open your 
eyes."
It's been happening for days.
Could he be right?
"A man needed the votes of two-thirds of the 
Sworn Brothers to become the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and after nine days and nine 
votes no one was even close to that."
"Lord Janos had been gaining, true, creeping up past first Bowen 
Marsh and then Othell Yarwyck, but he was still well behind Ser Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower 
and Cotter Pyke of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea."
"One of them will be the new Lord Commander, surely, Sam 
told himself."
Stannis had posted guards outside the maester's door too.
"Within, the rooms were hot and crowded 
with the wounded from the battle; black brothers, king's men, and queen's men, all three."
"Clydas was 
shuffling amongst them with flagons of goats' milk and dreamwine, but Maester Aemon had not yet 
Page 683

returned from his morning call on Mance Rayder."
"Sam hung his cloak upon a peg and went to lend a 
hand."
"But even as he fetched and poured and changed dressings, Jon's words nagged at him."
"Sam, 
you're a sweet fool."
Open your eyes.
It's been happening for days.
It was a good hour before he could excuse himself to feed the ravens.
"On the way up to the rookery, he 
stopped to check the tally he had made of last night's count."
"At the start of the choosing, more than thirty 
names had been offered, but most had withdrawn once it became clear they could not win."
"Seven 
remained as of last night."
"Ser Denys Mallister had collected two hundred and thirteen tokens, Cotter 
Pyke one hundred and eighty-seven, Lord Slynt seventy-four, Othell Yarwyck sixty, Bowen Marsh 
forty-nine, Three-Finger Hobb five, and Dolorous Edd Tollett one."
PYP and his stupid japes.
"Sam 
shuffled through the earlier counts."
"Ser Denys, Cotter Pyke, and Bowen Marsh had all been falling since 
the third day, Othell Yarwyck since the sixth."
"Only Lord Janos Slynt was climbing, day after day after 
day."
"He could hear the birds quorking in the rookery, so he put the papers away and climbed the steps to 
feed them."
"Three more ravens had come in, he saw with pleasure."
"""Snow,"" they cried at him."
"""Snow, 
snow, snow"" He had taught them that."
"Even with the newcomers, the ravenry seemed dismally empty."
Few of the birds that Aemon had sent off had returned as yet.
"One reached Stannis, though."
"One found 
Dragonstone, and a king who still cared."
"A thousand leagues south, Sam knew, his father had joined 
House Tarly to the cause of the boy on the Iron Throne, but neither King Joffrey nor little King Tornmen 
had bestirred himself when the Watch cried out for help."
"What good is a king who will not defend his 
realm?"
"he thought angrily, remembering the night on the Fist of the First Men and the terrible trek to 
Craster's Keep through darkness, fear, and falling snow."
"The queen's men made him uneasy, it was true, 
but at least they had come."
"That night at supper Sam looked for Jon Snow, but did not see him anywhere in the cavernous stone 
vault where the brothers now took their meals."
"He finally took a place on the bench near his other 
friends."
"Pyp was telling Dolorous Edd about the contest they'd had to see which of the straw soldiers 
could collect the most wildling arrows."
"""You were leading most of the way, but Watt of Long Lake got 
three in the last day and passed you."""
"""I never win anything,"" Dolorous Edd complained."
"""The gods always smiled on Watt, though."
"When the 
wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls, somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water."
"How 
lucky was that, missing all those rocks?"""
"""Was it a long fall?"""
Grenn wanted to know.
"""Did landing in the pool of water save his life?"""
"""No,"" said Dolorous Edd."
"""He was dead already, from that axe in his head."
"Still, it was pretty lucky, 
missing the rocks."""
"Three-Finger Hobb had promised the brothers roast haunch of mammoth that night, maybe in hopes of 
cadging a few more votes."
"If that was his notion, he should have found a younger mammoth, Sam 
thought, as he pulled a string of gristle out from between his teeth."
"Sighing, he pushed the food away."
"There would be another vote shortly, and the tensions in the air were thicker than the smoke."
"Cotter 
Pyke sat by the fire, surrounded by rangers from Eastwatch."
"Ser Denys Mallister was near the door with 
a smaller group of Shadow Tower men."
"fanos Slynt has the best place, Sam realized, halfway between 
the flames and the drafts."
"He was alarmed to see Bowen Marsh beside him, wan-faced and haggard, his 
head still wrapped in linen, but listening to all that Lord Janos had to say."
"When he pointed that out to his 
friends, Pyp said, ""And look down there, that's Ser Alliser whispering with Othell Yarwyck."""
"Page 684

After the meal Maester Aernon rose to ask if any of the brothers wished to speak before they cast their 
tokens."
"Dolorous Edd got up, stone-faced and glum as ever."
"""I just want to say to whoever is voting for 
me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander."
"But so would all these others."""
"He was 
followed by Bowen Marsh, who stood with one hand on Lord Slynt's shoulder."
"""Brothers and friends, I 
am asking that my name be withdrawn from this choosing."
"My wound still troubles me, and the task is 
too large for me, I fear ... but not for Lord Janos here, who 
commanded the gold cloaks of King's Landing for many years."
"Let us all give him our support."""
"Sam heard angry mutters from Cotter Pyke's end of the room, and Ser Denys looked at one of his 
companions and shook his head."
"It is too late, the damage is done."
"He wondered where Jon was, and 
why he had stayed away."
"Most of the brothers were unlettered, so by tradition the choosing was done by dropping tokens into a 
big potbellied iron kettle that Three-Finger Hobb and Owen the Oaf had dragged over from the kitchens."
"The barrels of tokens were off in a comer behind a heavy drape, so the voters could make their choice 
unseen."
"You were allowed to have a friend cast your token if you had duty, so some men took two 
tokens, three, or four, and Ser Denys and Cotter Pyke voted for the garrisons they had left behind."
"When the hall was finally empty, save for them, Sam and Clydas upended the kettle in front of Maester 
Aemon."
"A cascade of seashells, stones, and copper pennies covered the table."
"Aemon's wrinkled hands 
sorted with surprising speed, moving the shells here, the stones there, the pennies to one side, the 
occasional arrowhead, nail, and acom off to themselves."
"Sam and Clydas counted the piles, each of them 
keeping his own tally."
Tonight it was Sam's turn to give his results first.
"""Two hundred and three for Ser Denys Mallister,"" he 
said."
"""One hundred and sixty-nine for Cotter Pyke."
"One hundred and thirty-seven for Lord Janos Slynt, 
seventy-two for Othell Yarwyck, five for Three-Finger Hobb, and two for Dolorous Edd."""
"""I had one hundred and sixty-eight for Pyke,"" Clydas said."
"""We are two votes short by my count, and 
one by Sam's."""
"""Sam's count is correct,"" said Maester Aemon."
"""Jon Snow did not cast a token."
it makes no matter.
"No 
one is close."""
Sam was more relieved than disappointed.
"Even with Bowen Marsh's support, Lord Janos was still only 
third."
"""Who are these five who keep voting for Three-Finger Hobb?"""
he wondered.
"""Brothers who want him out of the kitchens?"""
said Clydas.
"""Ser Denys is down ten votes since yesterday,"" Sam pointed out."
"""And Cotter Pyke is down almost 
twenty."
"That's not good."""
"""Not good for their hopes of becoming Lord Commander, certainly,"" said Maester Aemon."
"""Yet it may 
be good for the Night's Watch, in the end."
That is not for us to say.
Ten days is not unduly long.
"There 
was once a choosing that lasted near two years, some seven hundred votes."
"The brothers will come to a 
decision in their own time."""
"Yes, Sam thought, but what decision?"
"Later, over cups of watered wine in the privacy of Pyp's cell, Sam's tongue loosened and he found 
Page 685

himself thinking aloud."
"""Cotter Pyke and 
Ser Denys Mallister have been losing ground, but between them they still have almost two-thirds,"" he 
told Pyp and Grenn."
"""Either one would be fine as Lord Commander."
"Someone needs to convince one of 
them to withdraw and support the other."""
"""Someone?"""
"said Grenn, doubtfully."
"""What someone?"""
"""Grenn is so dumb he thinks someone might be him,"" said Pyp."
"""Maybe when someone is done with 
Pyke and Mallister, he should convince King Stannis to marry Queen Cersei too."""
"""King Stannis is married,"" Grenn objected."
"""What am I going to do with him, Sam?"""
sighed Pyp.
"""Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys don't like each other much,"" Grenn argued stubbornly."
"""They fight about 
everything."""
"""Yes, but only because they have different ideas about what's best for the Watch,"" said Sam."
"""If we 
explained -"" 
""We?"""
said Pyp.
"""How did someone change to we?"
"I'm the mummer's monkey, remember?"
"And Grenn 
is, well, Grenn. """
"He smiled at Sam, and wiggled his ears."
"""You, now ... you're a lord's son, and the 
maester's steward."
".."" 
""And Sam the Slayer,"" said Grenn."
"""You slew an Other."""
"""It was the dragonglass that killed it,"" Sam told him for the hundredth time."
"""A lord's son, the maester's steward, and Sam the Slayer,"" Pyp mused."
"""You could talk to them, might 
be..."" 
""I could,"" said Sam, sounding as gloomy as Dolorous Edd, ""if I wasn't too craven to face them."""
"Chapter 76 
JON 
ion prowled around Satin in a slow circle, sword in hand, forcing him to turn."
"""Get your shield up,"" he 
said."
"""It's too heavy,"" the Oldtown boy complained."
"""It's as heavy as it needs to be to stop a sword,"" Jon 
said."
"""Now get it up."""
"He stepped forward, slashing."
"Satin jerked the shield up in time to catch the sword 
on its rim, and swung his own blade at Jon's ribs."
"""Good,"" Jon said, when he felt the impact on his own 
shield."
"""That was good."
But you need to put your body into it.
"Get your weight behind the steel and you'll 
do more damage than with arm strength alone."
"Come, try it again, drive at me, but keep the shield up or 
I'll ring your head like a bell..."" 
Page 686

Instead Satin took a step backward and raised his visor."
"""Jon,"" he said, in an anxious voice."
"When he turned, she was standing behind him, with half a dozen queen's men around her."
"Small wonder 
the yard grew so quiet."
"He had glimpsed Melisandre at her nightfires, and coming and going about the 
castle, but never so close."
"She's beautiful, he thought ... but there was something more than a little 
unsettling about red eyes."
"""my lady."""
"""The king would speak with you, Jon Snow."""
Jon thrust the practice sword into the earth.
"""Might I be allowed to change?"
"I am in no fit state to stand 
before a king."""
"""We shall await you atop the Wall,"" said Melisandre."
"We, Jon heard, not he."
It's as they say.
"This is his 
true queen, not the one he left at Eastwatch."
"He hung his mail and plate inside the armory, returned to his own cell, discarded his sweat-stained 
clothes, and donned a fresh set of blacks."
"It would be cold and windy in the cage, he knew, and colder 
and windier still on top of the ice, so he chose a heavy hooded cloak."
"Last of all he collected Longclaw, 
and slung the bastard sword across his back."
Melisandre was waiting for him at the base of the Wall.
She had sent her queen's men away.
"""What does 
His Grace want of me?"""
Jon asked her as they entered the cage.
"""All you have to give, Jon Snow."
"He is a king."""
He shut the door and pulled the bell cord.
The winch began to turn.
They rose.
"The day was bright and 
the Wall was weeping, long fingers of water trickling down its face and glinting in the sun."
"In the close 
confines of the iron cage, he was acutely aware of the red woman's presence."
She even smells red.
"The 
scent reminded him of Mikken's forge, of the way iron smelled when red-hot; the scent was smoke and 
blood."
"Kissed by fire, he thought, remembering Ygritte."
"The wind got in amongst Melisandre's long red 
robes and sent them flapping against Jon's legs as he stood beside her."
"""You are not cold, my lady?"""
"he 
asked her."
She laughed.
"""Never."""
"The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of her heart."
"""The 
Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
"Feel."""
"She put her hand on his cheek, and held it there while he felt 
how warm she was."
"""That is how life should feel,"" she told him."
"""Only death is cold."""
"They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall, brooding over the field where he 
had won his battle, and the great green forest beyond."
"He was dressed in the same black breeches, tunic, 
and boots that a brother of the Night's Watch might wear."
"Only his cloak set him apart; a heavy golden 
cloak trimmed in black fur, and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart."
"""I have brought you 
the Bastard of Winterfell, Your Grace,"" said Melisandre."
Stannis turned to study him.
Beneath his heavy brow were eyes like bottomless blue pools.
"His hollow 
cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the 
gauntness of his face, and his teeth were clenched."
"His neck and shoulders were clenched as well, and his 
right hand."
"Jon found himself remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon 
brothers."
Robert was the true steel.
"Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, but brittle, the way 
iron gets."
He'll break before he bends.
"Uneasily, he knelt, wondering why this brittle king had need of 
him."
"Page 687

""Rise."
"I have heard much and more of you, Lord Snow."""
"""I am no lord, sire."""
Jon rose.
"""I know what you have heard."
"That I am a tumcloak, and craven."
"That I 
slew my brother Qhorin Halfhand so the wildlings would spare my life."
"That I rode with Mance Rayder, 
and took a wildling wife."""
"""Aye."
"All that, and more."
"You are a warg too, they say, a skinchanger who walks at night as a wolf."""
King Stannis had a hard smile.
"""How much of it is true?"""
"""I had a direwolf, Ghost."
"I left him when I climbed the Wall near Greyguard, and have not seen him 
since."
Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join the wildlings.
"He knew they would make me kill him to 
prove myself, and told me to do whatever they asked of me."
The woman was named Ygritte.
"I broke my 
vows with her, but I swear to you on my father's name that I never turned my cloak."""
"""I believe you,"" the king said."
That startled him.
"""Why?"""
Stannis snorted.
"""I know Janos Slynt."
And I knew Ned Stark as well.
"Your father was no friend of mine, 
but only a fool would doubt his honor or his honesty."
"You have his look."""
"A big man, Stannis Baratheon 
towered over Jon, but he was so gaunt that he looked ten years older than he was."
"""I know more than 
you might think, Jon Snow."
"I know it was you who found the dragonglass dagger that Randyll Tarly's son 
used to slay the Other."""
"""Ghost found it."
"The blade was wrapped in a ranger's cloak and buried beneath the Fist of the First 
Men."
"There were other blades as well ... spearheads, arrowheads, all dragonglass."""
"""I know you held the gate here,"" King Stannis said."
"""If not, I would have come too late."""
"""Donal Noye held the gate."
"He died below in the tunnel, fighting the king of the giants."""
Stannis grimaced.
"""Noye made my first sword for me, and Robert's warharnmer as well."
"Had the god 
seen fit to spare him, he would have made a better Lord Commander for your order than any of these 
fools who are squabbling over it now."""
"""Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools, sire,"" Jon said."
"""They're good men, and capable."
"Othell Yarwyck as well, in his own way."
"Lord Mormont trusted each of them."""
"""Your Lord Mormont trusted too easily."
Else he would not have died as he did.
"But we were speaking 
of you."
"I have not forgotten that it was you who brought us this magic horn, and captured Mance 
Rayder's wife and son."""
"""Dalla died."""
Jon was saddened by that still.
"""Val is her sister."
"She and the babe did not require much 
capturing, Your Grace."
"You had put the wildlings; to flight, and the skinchanger Mance had left to guard 
his queen went mad when the eagle burned."""
Jon looked at Melisandre.
"""Some say that was your doing."""
"She smiled, her long copper hair tumbling across her face."
"""The Lord of Light has fiery talons, Jon 
Snow."""
"Jon nodded, and turned back to the king."
"""Your Grace, you spoke of Val."
"She has asked to see Mance 
Page 688

Rayder, to bring his son to him."
"it would be a ... a kindness."""
"""The man is a deserter from your order."
Your brothers are all insisting on his death.
"Why should I do him 
a kindness?"""
Jon had no answer for that.
"""If not for him, for Val."
"For her sister's sake, the child's mother."""
"""You are fond of this Val?"""
"""I scarcely know her."""
"""They tell me she is comely."""
"""Very,"" Jon admitted, 
""Beauty can be treacherous."
My brother learned that lesson from Cersei Larmister.
"She murdered him, 
do not doubt it."
"Your father and Jon Arryn as well."""
He scowled.
"""You rode with these wildlings."
"Is there 
any honor in them, do you think?"""
"""Yes,"" Jon said, ""but their own sort of honor, sire."""
"""In Mance Rayder?"""
"""Yes."
"I think so."""
"""In the Lord of Bones?"""
Jon hesitated.
"""Rattleshirt, we called him."
Treacherous and bloodthirsty.
"If there's honor in him, he hides 
it down beneath his suit of bones."""
"""And this other man, this Tormund of the many names who eluded us after the battle?"
"Answer me truly."""
"""Tormund Giantsbane seemed to me the sort of man who would make a good friend and a bad enemy, 
Your Grace."""
Stannis gave a curt nod.
"""Your father was a man of honor."
"He was no friend to me, but I saw his worth."
"Your brother was a rebel and a traitor who meant to steal half my kingdom, but no man can question his 
courage."
"What of you?"""
Does he want me to say I love him?
"Jon's voice was stiff and formal as he said, ""I am a man of the 
Night's Watch."""
"""Words."
Words are wind.
"Why do you think I abandoned Dragonstone and sailed to the Wall, Lord 
Snow?"""
"""I am no lord, sire."
"You came because we sent for you, I hope."
"Though I could not say why you took so 
long about it,"" 
Surprisingly, Stannis smiled at that."
"""You're bold enough to be a Stark."
"Yes, I should have come sooner."
"If not for my Hand, I might not have come at all."
"Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he 
reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights."
"I had the cart before the horse, Davos 
Page 689

said."
"I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the 
kingdom to win the throne."""
Stannis pointed north.
"""There is where I'll find the foe that I was bom to 
fight."""
"""His name may not be spoken,"" Melisandre added softly."
"""He is the God of Night and Terror, Jon 
Snow, and these shapes in the snow are his creatures."""
"""They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont's life,"" Stannis said."
"""it 
may be that this is your war as well, Lord Snow."
"If you will give me your help."""
"""My sword is pledged to the Night's Watch, Your Grace,"" Jon Snow answered carefully."
That did not please the king.
"Stannis ground his teeth and said, ""I need more than a sword from you."""
Jon was lost.
"""My lord?"""
"""I need the north."""
The north.
"""I ... my brother Robb was King in the North ."
.
.
"""Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell."
"if he had stayed home and done his duty, instead of 
crowning himself and riding off to conquer the riverlands, he might be alive today."
Be that as it may.
"You 
are not Robb, no more than I am Robert."""
The harsh words had blown away whatever sympathy Jon might have had for Stannis.
"""I loved my 
brother,"" he said."
"""And I mine."
"Yet they were what they were, and so are we."
"I am the only true king in Westeros, north 
or south."
"And you are Ned Stark's bastard."""
Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes.
"""Tywin 
Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North, to reward him for betraying your brother."
"The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy's death, yet they still hold Moat Cailin, 
Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and most of the Stony Shore."
"Your father's lands are bleeding, and 
I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds."
What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell.
"A 
loyal Lord of Winterfell."""
"He is looking at me, Jon thought, stunned."
"""Winterfell is no more."
"Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch."""
"""Granite does not bum easily,"" Stannis said."
"""The castle can be rebuilt, in time."
"It's not the walls that 
make a lord, it's the man, Your northmen do not know me, have no reason to love me, yet I will need 
their strength in the battles yet to come."
"I need a son of Eddard Stark to win them to my banner."""
He would make me Lord of Winterfell.
"The wind was gusting, and Jon felt so light-headed he was half 
afraid it would blow him off the Wall."
"""Your Grace,"" he said, ""you forget."
"I am a Snow, not a Stark."""
"""It's you who are forgetting,"" King Stannis replied."
Melisandre put a warm hand on Jon's arm.
"""A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke, Lord 
Snow."""
"Page 690

Lord Snow."
"Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that, to mock his 
bastard birth."
"Many of his brothers had taken to using it as well, some with affection, others to wound."
But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jon's ears.
It sounded ... real.
"""Yes,"" he said, hesitantly, 
""kings have legitimized bastards before, but ..."
I am still a brother of the Night's Watch.
"I knelt before a 
heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children."""
"""Jon."""
Melisandre was so close he could feel the warmth of her breath.
"""R'hllor is the only true god."
"A 
vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes."
"Open your heart and let the light 
of the Lord come in."
"Bum these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light."""
"When Jon had been very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to 
dream that one day Winterfell."
might be his.
"Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those 
dreams."
Winterfell.
"would go to Robb and then his sons, or to Bran or Rickon should Robb die childless."
And after them came Sansa and Arya.
"Even to dream otherwise seemed disloyal, as if he were betraying 
them in his heart, wishing for their deaths."
"I never wanted this, he thought as he stood before the 
blue-eyed king and the red woman."
"I loved Robb, loved an of them ..."
"I never wanted any harm to come 
to any of them, but it did."
And now there's only me.
"All he had to do was say the word, and he would be 
Jon Stark, and nevermore a Snow."
"All he had to do was pledge this king his fealty, and Winterfell was 
his."
"All he had to do ... 
... was forswear his vows again."
And this time it would not be a ruse.
"To claim his father's castle, he must turn against his father's gods."
"King Stannis gazed off north again, his gold cloak streaming from his shoulders."
"""It may be that I am 
mistaken in you, Jon Snow."
We both know the things that are said of bastards.
"You may lack your 
father's honor, or your brother's skill in arms."
But you are the weapon the Lord has given me.
"I have 
found you here, as you found the cache of dragonglass beneath the Fist, and I mean to make use of you."
Even Azor Ahai did not win his war alone.
"I killed a thousand wildlings, took another thousand captive, 
and scattered the rest, but we both know they will return."
Melisandre has seen that in her fires.
"This 
Tormund Thunderfist is likely re-forming them even now, and planning some new assault."
"And the more 
we bleed each other, the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon us."""
Jon had come to that same realization.
"""As you say, Your Grace."""
"He wondered where this king was 
going."
"""Whilst your brothers have been struggling to decide who shall lead them, I have been speaking with this 
Mance Rayder."""
He ground his teeth.
"""A stubborn man, that one, and prideful."
"He will leave me no 
choice but to give him to the flames."
"But we took other captives as well, other leaders."
"The one who 
calls himself the Lord of Bones, some of their clan chiefs, the new Magnar of Therm."
"Your brothers will 
not like it, no more than your father's lords, but I mean to allow the wildlings through the Wall ... those 
who will swear me their fealty, pledge to keep the king's peace and the king's laws, and take the Lord of 
Light as their god."
"Even the giants, if those great knees of theirs can bend."
"I will settle them on the Gift, 
once I have wrested it away from your new Lord Commander."
"When the cold winds rise, we shall live or 
die together."
"It is time we made alliance against our common foe."""
He looked at Jon.
"""Would you agree? 
"""
"Page 691

""My father dreamed of resettling the Gift,"" Jon admitted."
"""He and my uncle Benjen used to talk of it."""
"He 
never thought of settling it with wildlings, though ... but he never rode with wildlings, either."
"He did not 
fool himself; the free folk would make for unruly subjects and dangerous neighbors."
"Yet when he 
weighed Ygritte's red hair against the cold blue eyes of the wights, the choice was easy."
"""I agree."""
"""Good,"" King Stannis said, ""for the surest way to seal a new alliance is with a marriage."
"I mean to wed 
my Lord of Winterfell to this wildling princess."""
Perhaps Jon had ridden with the free folk too long; he could not help but laugh.
"""Your Grace,"" he said, 
""captive or no, if you think you can just give Val to me, I fear you have a deal to learn about wildling 
women."
"Whoever weds her had best be prepared to climb in her tower window and carry her off at 
swordpoint ."
.
". """
"""Whoever?"""
Stannis gave him a measuring look.
"""Does this mean you will not wed the girl?"
"I warn you, 
she is part of the price you must pay, if you want your father's name and your father's castle."
"This match 
is necessary, to help assure the loyalty of our new subjects."
"Are you refusing me, Jon Snow?"""
"""No,"" Jon said, too quickly."
"It was Winterfell the king was speaking of, and Winterfell was not to be 
lightly refused."
"""I mean ... this has all come very suddenly, Your Grace."
"Might I beg you for some time to 
consider?"""
"""As you wish."
But consider quickly.
"I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to 
discover."""
"Stannis put a thin, fleshless hand on Jon's shoulder."
"""Say nothing of what we've discussed here 
today."
To anyone.
"But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and 
pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell."""
"Chapter 77 
TYRION 
When he heard noises through the thick wooden door of his cell, Tyrion Lannister prepared to die."
"Past time, he thought."
"Come on, come on, make an end to it."
He pushed himself to his feet.
"His legs 
were asleep from being folded under him."
He bent down and rubbed the knives from them.
"I will not go 
stumbling and waddling to the headsman's block."
"He wondered whether they would kill him down here in the dark or drag him through the city so Ser Ilyn 
Payne could lop his head off."
"After his mummer's farce of a trial, his sweet sister and loving father might 
prefer to dispose of him quietly, rather than risk a public execution."
"I could tell the mob a few choice 
things, if they let me speak."
But would they be that foolish?
"As the keys rattled and the door to his cell pushed inward, creaking, Tyrion pressed back against the 
dampness of the wall, wishing for a weapon."
I can still bite and kick.
"I'll die with the taste of blood in my 
mouth, that's something."
He wished he'd been able to think of some rousing last words.
"""Bugger you all"" 
was not like to earn him much of a place in the histories."
Torchlight fell across his face.
He shielded his eyes with a hand.
"""Come on, are you frightened of a 
Page 692

dwarf?"
"Do it, you son of a poxy whore."""
His voice had grown hoarse from disuse.
"'Is that any way to speak about our lady mother?"""
"The man moved forward, a torch in his left hand."
"""This is even more ghastly than my cell at Riverrun, though not quite so dank."""
For a moment Tyrion could not breathe.
"""You?"""
"""Well, most of me."""
"Jaime was gaunt, his hair hacked short."
"""I left a hand at Harrenhal."
"Bringing the 
Brave Companions across the narrow sea was not one of Father's better notions."""
"He lifted his arm, and 
Tyrion saw the stump."
A bark of hysterical laughter burst from his lips.
"""Oh, gods,"" he said."
"""Jaime, I am so sorry, but ... gods 
be good, look at the two of us."
"Handless and Noseless the Lannister boys."""
"""There were days when my hand smelled so bad I wished I was noseless."""
"Jaime lowered the torch, so 
the light bathed his brother's face."
"""An impressive scar."""
Tyrion turned away from the glare.
"""They made me fight a battle without my big brother to protect me."""
"""I heard tell you almost burned the city down."""
"""A filthy lie."
"I only burned the river."""
"Abruptly, Tyrion remembered where he was, and why."
"""Are you 
here to kill me?"""
"""Now that's ungrateful."
"Perhaps I should leave you here to rot if you're going to be so discourteous."""
"""Rotting is not the fate Cersei has in mind for me."""
"""Well no, if truth be told."
"You're to be beheaded on the morrow, out on the old tourney grounds."""
Tyrion laughed again.
"""Will there be food?"
"You'll have to help me with my last words, my wits have been 
running about like a rat in a root cellar."""
"""You won't need last words."
"I'm rescuing you."""
Jaime's voice was strangely solemn.
"""Who said I required rescue?"""
"""You know, I'd almost forgotten what an annoying little man you are."
"Now that you've reminded me, I 
do believe I'll let Cersei cut your head off after all."""
"""Oh no you won't."""
He waddled out of the cell.
"""Is it day or night up above?"
"I've lost all sense of time."""
"""Three hours past midnight."
"The city sleeps."""
"Jaime slid the torch back into its sconce, on the wall 
between the cells."
"The corridor was so poorly lit that Tyrion almost stumbled on the turnkey, sprawled across the cold 
stone floor."
He prodded him with a toe.
"""Is he dead?"""
"""Asleep."
The other three as well.
"The eunuch dosed their wine with sweetsleep, but not enough to kill 
them."
Or so he swears.
"He is waiting back at the stair, dressed up in a septon's robe."
"You're going down 
into the sewers, and from there to the river."
A galley is waiting in the bay.
"Varys has agents in the Free 
Page 693

Cities who will see that you do not lack for funds ... but try not to be conspicuous."
"Cersei will send men 
after you, I have no doubt."
"You might do well to take another name."""
"""Another name?"
"Oh, certainly."
"And when the Faceless Men come to 
kill me, I'll say, 'No, you have the wrong man, I'm a different dwarf with a hideous facial scar.""'"
"Both 
Lannisters laughed at the absurdity of it all."
"Then Jaime went to one knee and kissed him quickly once on 
each cheek, his lips brushing against the puckered ribbon of scar tissue."
"""Thank you, Brother,"" Tyrion said."
"""For my life."""
"""It was ... a debt I owed you."""
Jaime's voice was strange.
"""A debt?"""
He cocked his head.
"""I do not understand."""
"""Good."
"Some doors are best left closed."""
"""Oh, dear,"" said Tyrion."
"""Is there something grim and ugly behind it?"
"Could it be that someone said 
something cruel about me once?"
I'll try not to weep.
"Tell me."""
"""Tyrion..."" 
faime is afraid."
"""Tell me,"" Tyrion said again."
His brother looked away.
"""Tysha,"" he said softly."
"""Tysha?"""
His stomach tightened.
"""What of her?"""
"""She was no whore."
I never bought her for you.
That was a lie that Father commanded me to tell.
"Tysha 
was ... she was what she seemed to be."
"A crofter's daughter, chance met on the road."""
Tyrion could hear the faint sound of his own breath whistling hollowly through the scar of his nose.
"Jaime 
could not meet his eyes."
Tysha.
He tried to remember what she had looked like.
"A girl, she was only a 
girl, no older than Sansa."
"""My wife,"" he croaked."
"""She wed me."""
"""For your gold, Father said."
"She was lowborn, you were a Lannister of Casterly Rock."
"All she wanted 
was the gold, which made her no different from a whore, so ... so it would not be a lie, not truly, and ... 
he said that you required a sharp lesson."
"That you would learn from it, and thank me later ."
.
". """
"""Thank you?"""
Tyrion's voice was choked.
"""He gave her to his guards."
A barracks full of guards.
"He 
made me ..."
"watch."""
"Aye, and more than watch."
"I took her too ... my wife ... 
""I never knew he would do that."
"You must believe me."""
"""Oh, must I"" Tyrion snarled."
"""Why should I believe you about anything, ever?"
"She was my wife!"""
"""Tyrion -it 
He hit him."
"It was a slap, backhanded, but he put all his strength into it, all his fear, all his rage, all his 
pain."
"Jaime was squatting, unbalanced."
The blow sent him tumbling backward to the floor.
"""I ..."
"I 
suppose I earned that."""
"Page 694

""Oh, you've earned more than that, Jaime."
"You and my sweet sister and our loving father, yes, I can't 
begin to tell you what you've earned."
"But you'll have it, that I swear to you."
"A Lannister always pays his 
debts."""
"Tyrion waddled away, almost stumbling over the turnkey again in his haste."
"Before he had gone a 
dozen yards, he bumped up against an irongate that closed the passage."
"Oh, gods."
"it was all he could do 
not to scream."
Jaime came up behind him.
"""I have the gaoler's keys."""
"""Then use them."""
Tyrion stepped aside.
"Jaime unlocked the gate, pushed it open, and stepped through."
He looked back over his shoulder.
"""Are 
you coming?"""
"""Not with you."""
Tyrion stepped through.
"""Give me the keys and go."
"I will find Varys on my own."""
"He 
cocked his head and stared up at his brother with his mismatched eyes."
"""Jaime, can you flght 
left-handed?"""
"""Rather less well than you,"" Jaime said bitterly."
"""Good."
Then we will be well matched if we should ever meet again.
"The cripple and the dwarf."""
Jaime handed him the ring of keys.
"""I gave you the truth."
You owe me the same.
Did you do it?
"Did you 
kill him?"""
"The question was another knife, twisting in his guts."
"""Are you sure you want to know?"""
asked Tyrion.
"""Joffrey would have been a worse king than Aerys ever was."
"He stole his father's dagger and gave it to a 
footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark, did you know that?"""
"""I ..."
"I thought he might have."""
"""Well, a son takes after his father."
"Joff would have killed me as well, once he came into his power."
"For 
the crime of being short and ugly, of which I am so conspicuously guilty."""
"""You have not answered my question."""
"""You poor stupid blind crippled fool."
Must I spell every little thing out for you?
Very well.
"Cersei is a 
lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know."
And I am the monster they all say I am.
"Yes, I killed your vile son."""
He made himself grin.
"It must have 
been a hideous sight to see, there in the torchlit gloom."
Jaime turned without a word and walked away.
"Tyrion watched him go, striding on his long strong legs, and part of him wanted to call out, to tell him that 
it wasn't true, to beg for his forgiveness."
"But then he thought of Tysha, and he held his silence."
"He listened 
to the receding footsteps until he could hear them no longer, then waddled off to look for Varys."
"The eunuch was lurking in the dark of a twisting turnpike stair, garbed in a moth-eaten brown robe with 
a hood that hid the paleness of his face."
"""You were so long, I feared that something had gone amiss,"" he 
said when he saw Tyrion."
"Page 695

""Oh, no,"" Tyrion assured him, in poisonous tones."
"""What could possibly have gone amiss?"""
"He twisted 
his head back to stare up."
"""I sent for you during my trial."""
"""I could not come."
"The queen had me watched, night and day."
"I dared not help you."""
"""You're helping me now."""
"""Am I?"
"Ah."""
Varys giggled.
"It seemed strangely out of place in this place of cold stone and echoing 
darkness."
"""Your brother can be most persuasive."""
"""Varys, you are as cold and slimy as a slug, has anyone ever told you?"
You did your best to kill me.
"Perhaps I ought to return the favor."""
The eunuch sighed.
"""The faithful dog is kicked, and no matter how the spider weaves, he is never loved."
"But if you slay me here, I fear for you, my lord."
"You may never find your way back to daylight."""
"His eyes 
glittered in the shifting torchlight, dark and wet."
"""These tunnels are full of traps for the unwary."""
Tyrion snorted.
"""Unwary?"
"I'm the wariest man who ever lived, you helped see to that."""
"He rubbed at his 
nose."
"""So tell me, wizard, where is my innocent maiden wife?"""
"""I have found no trace of Lady Sansa in King's Landing sad to say."
"Nor of Ser Dontos Hollard, who by 
rights should have turned up somewhere drunk by now."
"They were seen together on the serpentine steps 
the night she vanished."
"After that, nothing."
There was much confusion that night.
"My little birds are silent."""
Varys gave a gentle tug at the dwarf's sleeve and pulled him into the stair.
"""My lord, we must away."
"Your 
path is down."""
"That's no lie, at least."
"Tyrion waddled along in the eunuch's wake, his heels scraping against the rough 
stone as they descended."
"It was very cold within the stairwell, a damp bone-chilling cold that set him to 
shivering at once."
"""What part of the dungeons are these?"""
he asked.
"""Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle,"" Varys replied."
"""On the upper level, 
there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together."
"They have narrow windows set 
high in the walls."
The second level has the smaller cells where highborn captives are held.
"They have no 
windows, but torches in the halls cast light through the bars."
"On the third level the cells are smaller and 
the doors are wood."
"The black cells, men call them."
"That was where you were kept, and Eddard Stark 
before you."
But there is a level lower still.
"Once a man is taken down to the fourth level, he never sees 
the sun again, nor hears a human voice, nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain."
"Maegor had the 
cells on the fourth level built for torment."""
They had reached the bottom of the steps.
"An unlighted door 
opened before them."
"""This is the fourth level."
"Give me your hand, my lord."
"It is safer to walk in darkness 
here."
"There are things you would not wish to see."""
Tyrion hung back a moment.
Varys had already betrayed him once.
"Who knew what game the eunuch 
was playing?"
"And what better place to murder a man than down in the darkness, in a place that no one 
knew existed?"
His body might never be found.
"On the other hand, what choice did he have?"
To go back up the steps and walk out the main gate?
"No, 
that would not serve."
"Jaime would not be afraid, he thought, before he remembered what Jaime had done to him."
"He took the 
eunuch by the hand and let himself be led through the black, following the soft scrape of leather on stone."
"Varys walked quickly, from time to time whispering, ""Careful, there are three steps ahead,"" or, ""The 
Page 696

tunnel slopes downward here, my lord."""
"I arrived here a King's Hand, riding through the gates at the head 
of my own sworn men, Tyrion reflected, and I leave like a rat scuttling through the dark, holding hands 
with a spider."
"A light appeared ahead of them, too dim to be daylight, and grew as they hurried toward it."
"After a while 
he could see it was an arched doorway, closed off by another iron gate."
Varys produced a key.
"They 
stepped through into a small round chamber."
"Five other doors opened off the room, each barred in iron."
"There was an opening in the ceiling as well, and a series of rungs set in the wall below, leading upward."
"An ornate brazier stood to one side, fashioned in the shape of a dragon's head."
"The coals in the beast's 
yawning mouth had burnt down to embers, but they still glowed with a sullen orange light."
"Dim as it was, 
the light was welcome after the blackness of the tunnel."
"The juncture was otherwise empty, but on the floor was a mosaic of a three-headed dragon wrought in 
red and black tiles."
Something niggled at Tyrionfor a moment.
Then it came to him.
"This is the place Shae 
told me of, when Varys first led her to my bed."
"""We are below the Tower of the Hand."""
"""Yes."""
Frozen hinges screamed in protest as Varys pulled open a longclosed door.
"Flakes of rust drifted 
to the floor."
"""This will take us out to the river."""
"Tyrion walked slowly to the ladder, ran his hand across the lowest rung."
"""This will take me up to my 
bedchamber."""
"""Your lord father's bedchamber now."""
He looked up the shaft.
"""How far must I climb?"""
"""My lord, you are too weak for such follies, and there is besides no time."
"We must go."""
"""I have business above."
"How far?"""
"""Two hundred and thirty rungs, but whatever you intend 
""Two hundred and thirty rungs, and then?"""
"""The tunnel to the left, but hear me - "" 
""How far along to the bedchamber?"""
Tyrion lifted a foot to the lowest rung of the ladder.
"""No more than sixty feet."
Keep one hand on the wall as you go.
You will feel the doors.
"The 
bedchamber is the third."""
He sighed.
"""This is folly, my lord."
Your brother has given you your life back.
"Would you cast it away, and mine with it?"""
"""Varys, the only thing I value less than my life just now is yours."
"Wait for me here."""
"He turned his back 
on the eunuch and began to climb, counting silently as he went."
"Rung by rung, he ascended into darkness."
"At first he could see the dim outline of each rung as he 
grasped it, and the rough grey texture of the stone behind, but as he climbed the black grew thicker."
Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen.
"By thirty, his arms trembled with the strain of pulling."
"He paused a 
moment to catch his breath and glanced down."
"A circle of faint light shone far below, half obscured by 
his own feet."
Tyrion resumed his ascent.
Thirty-nine forty forty-one.
"By fifty, his legs burned."
"The ladder 
was endless, numbing."
Sixty-eight sixty-nine seventy.
"By eighty, his back was a dull agony."
"Yet still he 
Page 697

climbed."
He could not have said why.
One thirteen one fourteen one fifteen.
"At two hundred and thirty, the shaft was black as pitch, but he could feel the warm air flowing from the 
tunnel to his left, like the breath of some great beast."
"He poked about awkwardly with a foot and edged 
off the ladder."
The tunnel was even more cramped than the shaft.
"Any man of normal size would have 
had to crawl on hands and knees, but Tyrion was short enough to walk upright."
"At last, a place made for 
dwarfs."
His boots scuffed softly against the stone.
"He walked slowly, counting steps, feeling for gaps in 
the walls."
"Soon he began to hear voices, muffled and indistinct at first, then clearer."
"He listened more 
closely."
"Two of his father's guardsmen were joking about the Imp's whore, saying how sweet it would be 
to fuck her, and how bad she must want a real cock in place of the dwarf's stunted little thing."
"""Most like 
it's got a crook in it,"" said Lum."
That led him into a discussion of how Tyrion would die on the morrow.
"""He'll weep like a woman and beg for mercy, you'll see,"" Lum insisted."
"Lester figured he'd face the axe 
brave as a lion, being a Lannister, and he was willing to bet his new boots on it."
"""Ah, shit in your boots,"" 
said Lum, ""you know they'd never fit these feet Wmine."
"Tell you what, if I win you can scour my bloody 
mail for a fortnight."""
"For the space of a few feet, Tyrion could hear every word of their haggling, but when he moved on, the 
voices faded quickly."
"Small wonder Varys did not want me to climb the bloody ladder, Tyrion thought, 
smiling in the dark."
Little birds indeed.
"He came to the third door and fumbled about for a long time before his fingers brushed a small iron hook 
set between two stones."
"When he pulled down on it, there was a soft rumble that sounded loud as an 
avalanche in the stillness, and a square of dull orange light opened a foot to his left."
The hearth!
He almost laughed.
"The fireplace was full of hot ash, and a black log with a hot orange heart 
burning within."
"He edged past gingerly, taking quick steps so as not to bum his boots, the warm cinders 
crunching 
softly under his heels."
"When he found himself in what had once been his bedchamber, he stood a long 
moment, breathing the silence."
Had his father heard?
"Would he reach for his sword, raise the hue and 
cry?"
"""M'lord?"""
a woman's voice called.
"That might have hurt me once, when I still felt pain."
The first step was the hardest.
"When he reached the 
bed Tyrion pulled the draperies aside and there she was, turning toward him with a sleepy smile on her 
lips."
It died when she saw him.
"She pulled the blankets up to her chin, as if that would protect her."
"""Were you expecting someone taller, sweetling?"""
Big wet tears filled her eyes.
"""I never meant those things I said, the queen made me."
Please.
"Your father 
frightens me so."""
"She sat up, letting the blanket slide down to her lap."
"Beneath it she was naked, but for 
the chain about her throat."
"A chain of linked golden hands, each holding the next."
"""My lady Shae,"" Tyrion said softly."
"""All the time I sat in the black cell waiting to die, I kept remembering 
how beautiful you were."
"in silk or roughspun or nothing at all..."" 
""M'lord will be back soon."
"You should go, or ... did you come to take me away?"""
"""Did you ever like it?"""
"He cupped her cheek, remembering all the times he had done this before."
"All the 
times he'd slid his hands around her waist, squeezed her small firm breasts, stroked her short dark hair, 
Page 698

touched her lips, her cheeks, her ears."
"All the times he had opened her with a finger to probe her secret 
sweetness and make her moan."
"""Did you ever like my touch?"""
"""More than anything,"" she said, ""my giant of Lannister."""
"That was the worst thing you could have said, sweetling."
"Tyrion slid a hand under his father's chain, and twisted."
"The links tightened, digging into her neck."
"""For 
hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm,"" he said."
"He gave cold hands another 
twist as the warm ones beat away his tears."
Afterward he found Lord Tywin's dagger on the bedside table and shoved it through his belt.
"A 
lion-headed mace, a poleaxe, and a crossbow had been hung on the walls."
"The poleaxe would be clumsy 
to wield inside a castle, and the mace was too high to reach, but a large wood-and-iron chest had been 
placed against the wall directly under the crossbow."
"He climbed up, pulled down the bow and a leather 
quiver packed with quarrels, jammed a foot into the stirrup, and pushed down until the bowstring 
cocked."
Then he slipped a bolt into the notch.
Jaime had lectured him more than once on the drawbacks of crossbows.
"If Lum and Lester emerged 
from wherever they were talking, he'd never have time to reload, but at least he'd take one down to hell 
with him."
"Lum, if he had a choice."
"You'll have to clean your own mail, Lum."
You lose.
"Waddling to the door, he listened a moment, then eased it open slowly."
"A lamp burned in a stone niche, 
casting wan yellow light over the empty hallway."
Only the flame was moving.
"Tyrion slid out, holding the 
crossbow down against his leg."
"He found his father where he knew he'd find him, seated in the dimness of the privy tower, bedrobe 
hiked up around his hips."
"At the sound of steps, Lord Tywin raised his eyes."
Tyrion gave him a mocking half bow.
"""My lord."""
"""Tyrion."""
"If he was afraid, Tywin Lannister gave no hint of it."
"""Who released you from your cell?"""
"""I'd love to tell you, but I swore a holy oath."""
"""The eunuch,"" his father decided."
"""I'll have his head for this."
Is that my crossbow?
"Put it down."""
"""Will you punish me if I refuse, Father?"""
"""This escape is folly."
"You are not to be killed, if that is what you fear."
"It's still my intent to send you to 
the Wall, but I could not do it without Lord Tyrell's consent."
"Put down the crossbow and we will go 
back to my chambers and talk of it."""
"""We can talk here just as well."
"Perhaps I don't choose to go to the Wall, Father."
"It's bloody cold up 
there, and I believe I've had enough coldness from you."
"So just tell me something, and I'll be on my way."
"One simple question, you owe me that much."""
"""I owe you nothing."""
"""You've given me less than that, all my life, but you'll give me this."
"What did you do with Tysha?"""
"Page 699

""Tysha?"""
He does not even remember her name.
"""The girl I married."""
"""Oh, yes."
"Your first whore."""
Tyrion took aim at his father's chest.
"""The next time you say that word, I'll kill you."""
"""You do not have the courage."""
"""Shall we find out?"
"It's a short word, and it seems to come so easily to your lips."""
"Tyrion gestured 
impatiently with the bow."
"""Tysha."
"What did you do with her, after my little lesson?"""
"""I don't recall."""
"""Try harder."
"Did you have her killed?"""
His father pursed his lips.
"""There was no reason for that, she'd learned her place ... and had been well 
paid for her day's work, I seem to recall."
I suppose the steward sent her on her way.
"I never thought to 
inquire."""
"""On her way where?"""
"""Wherever whores go."""
Tyrion's finger clenched.
The crossbow whanged just as Lord Tywin started to rise.
"The bolt slammed 
into him above the groin and he sat back down with a grunt."
"The quarrel had sunk deep, right to the 
fletching."
"Blood seeped out around the shaft, dripping down into his pubic hair and over his bare thighs."
"""You shot me,"" he said incredulously, his eyes glassy with shock."
"""You always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord,"" Tyrion said."
"""That must be why you're the Hand 
of the King."""
"""You ... you are no ... no son of mine."""
"""Now that's where you're wrong, Father."
"Why, I believe I'm you writ small."
"Do me a kindness now, and 
die quickly."
"I have a ship to catch."""
"For once, his father did what Tyrion asked him."
"The proof was the sudden stench, as his bowels 
loosened in the moment of death."
"Well, he was in the right place for it, Tyrion thought."
"But the stink that 
filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie."
"Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold."
"Chapter 78 
SAMWELL 
Page 700

The king was angry."
Sam saw that at once.
"As the black brothers entered one by one and knelt before him, Stannis shoved away his breakfast of 
hardbread, salt beef, and boiled eggs, and eyed them coldly."
"Beside him, the red woman Melisandre 
looked as if she found the scene amusing."
"I have no place here, Sam thought anxiously, when her red eyes fell upon him."
"Someone had to help 
Maester Aemon up the steps."
"Don't look at me, I'm just the maester's steward."
"The others were 
contenders for the Old Bear's command, all but Bowen Marsh, who had withdrawn from the contest but 
remained castellan and Lord Steward."
"Sam did not understand why Melisandre should seem so 
interested in him."
King Stannis kept the black brothers on their knees for an extraordinarily long time.
"""Rise,"" he said at 
last."
Sam gave Maester Aemon his shoulder to help him back up.
The sound of Lord Janos Slynt clearing his throat broke the strained silence.
"""Your Grace, let me say 
how pleased we are to be summoned here."
"When I saw your banners from the Wall, I knew the realm 
was saved."
'There comes a man who neer forgets his duty/ I said to good Ser Alliser.
"'A strong man, and 
a true king.'"
May I congratulate you on your victory over the savages?
"The singers will make much of it, I 
know - "" 
""The singers may do as they like,"" Stannis snapped."
"""Spare me your fawning, Janos, it will not serve 
you."""
He rose to his feet and frowned at them all.
"""Lady Melisandre tells me that you have not yet chosen 
a Lord Commander."
I am displeased.
"How much longer must this folly last?"""
"""Sire,"" said Bowen Marsh in a defensive tone, ""no one has achieved two-thirds of the vote yet."
"It has 
only been ten days."""
"""Nine days too long."
"I have captives to dispose of, a realm to order, a war to fight."
"Choices must be 
made, decisions that involve the Wall and the Night's Watch."
"By rights your Lord Commander should 
have a voice in those decisions."""
"""He should, yes,"" said Janos Slynt."
"""But it must be said."
We brothers are only simple soldiers.
"Soldiers, 
yes!"
And Your Grace will know that soldiers are most comfortable taking orders.
"They would benefit 
from your royal guidance, it seems to me."
For the good of the realm.
"To help them choose wisely."""
The suggestion outraged some of the others.
"""Do you want the king to wipe our arses for us too?"""
"said 
Cotter Pyke angrily."
"""The choice of a Lord Commander belongs to the Sworn Brothers, and to them 
alone,"" insisted Ser Denys Mallister."
"""If they choose wisely they won't be choosing me,"" moaned 
Dolorous Edd."
"Maester Aemon, calm as always, said, ""Your Grace, the Night's Watch has been 
choosing its own leader since Brandon the Builder raised the Wall."
"Through Jeor Mormont we have had 
nine hundred and ninety-seven Lords Commander in unbroken succession, each chosen by the men he 
would lead, a tradition many thousands of years old."""
Stannis ground his teeth.
"""It is not my wish to tamper with your rights and traditions."
"As to royal 
guidance, Janos, if you mean that I ought to tell your brothers to choose you, have the courage to say 
so."""
"Page 701

That took Lord Janos aback."
"He smiled uncertainly and began to sweat, but Bowen Marsh beside him 
said, ""Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?"""
"""Any of you, I would think."
"Even the cook."""
The look the king gave Slynt was cold.
"""Janos was hardly 
the first gold cloak ever to take a bribe, I grant you, but he may have been the first commander to fatten 
his purse by selling places and promotions."
"By the end he must have had half the officers in the City 
Watch paying him part of their wages."
"Isn't that so, Janos? """
Slynt's neck was purpling.
"""Lies, all lies!"
"A strong man makes enemies, Your Grace knows that, they 
whisper lies behind your back."
"Naught was ever proven, not a man came forward..."" 
""Two men who were prepared to come forward died suddenly on their rounds."""
"Stannis narrowed his 
eyes."
"""Do not trifle with me, my lord."
I saw the proof Jon Arryn laid before the small council.
"If I had 
been king you would have lost more than your office, I promise you, but Robert shrugged away your little 
lapses."
'They all steal/ I recall him saying.
"'Better a thief we know than one we don't, the next man might 
be worse.'"
"Lord Petyr's words in my brother's mouth, I'll warrant."
"Littlefinger had a nose for gold, and 
I'm certain he arranged matters so the crown profited as much from your corruption as you did yourself."""
"Lord Slynt's jowls were quivering, but before he could frame a further protest Maester Aemon said, 
""Your Grace, by law a man's past crimes and transgressions are wiped clean when he says his words and 
becomes a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch."""
"""I am aware of that."
"If it happens that Lord Janos here is the best the Night's Watch can offer, I shall grit 
my teeth and choke him down."
"It is naught to me which man of you is chosen, so long as you make a 
choice."
"We have a war to fight."""
"""Your Grace,"" said Ser Denys Mallister, in tones of wary courtesy."
"""If you are speaking of the wildlings ."
.
". """
"""I am not."
"And you know that, ser."""
"""And you must know that whilst we are thankful for the aid you rendered us against Mance Rayder, we 
can offer you no help in your contest for the throne."
"The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the 
Seven Kingdoms."
"For eight thousand years - "" 
""I know your history, Ser Denys,"" the king said brusquely."
"""I give you my word, I shall not ask you to lift 
your swords against any of the rebels and usurpers who plague me."
"I do expect that you will continue to 
defend the Wall as you always have."""
"""We'll defend the Wall to the last man,"" said Cotter Pyke."
"""Probably me,"" said Dolorous Edd, in a resigned tone."
Stannis crossed his arms.
"""I shall require a few other things from you as well."
"Things that you may not be 
so quick to give."
I want your castles.
"And I want the Gift."""
Those blunt words burst among the black brothers like a pot of wildfire tossed onto a brazier.
"Marsh, 
Mallister, and Pyke all tried to speak at once."
King Stannis let them talk.
"When they were done, he said, 
""I have three times the men you do."
"I can take the lands if I wish, but I would prefer to do this legally, 
with your consent."""
"Page 702

""The Gift was given to the Night's Watch in perpetuity, Your Grace,"" Bowen Marsh insisted."
"""Which means it cannot be lawfully seized, attainted, or taken from you."
"But what was given once can be 
given again."""
"""What will you do with the Gift?"""
demanded Cotter Pyke.
"""Make better use of it than you have."
"As to the castles, Eastwatch, Castle Black, and the Shadow 
Tower shall remain yours."
"Garrison them as you always have, but I must take the others for my garrisons 
if we are to hold the Wall."""
"""You do not have the men,"" objected Bowen Marsh."
"""Some of the abandoned castles are scarce more than ruins,"" said Othell Yarwyck, the First Builder."
"""Ruins can be rebuilt."""
"""Rebuilt?"""
Yarwyck said.
"""But who will do the work?"""
"""That is my concern."
"I shall require a list from you, detailing the present state of every castle and what 
might be required to restore it."
"I mean to have them all garrisoned again within the year, and nightfires 
burning before their gates."""
"""Nightfires?"""
Bowen Marsh gave Melisandre an uncertain look.
"""We're to light nightfires now?"""
"""You are."""
"The woman rose in a swirl of scarlet silk, her long copperbright hair tumbling about her 
shoulders."
"""Swords alone cannot hold this darkness back."
Only the light of the Lord can do that.
"Make 
no mistake, good sers and valiant brothers, the war we've come to fight is no petty squabble over lands 
and honors."
"Ours is a war for life itself, and should we fail the world dies with us."""
"The officers did not know how to take that, Sam could see."
"Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck 
exchanged a doubtful look, Janos Slynt was fuming, and Three-Finger Hobb looked as though he would 
sooner be back chopping carrots."
"But all of them seemed surprised to hear Maester Aemon murmur, ""It 
is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady."
"But where is the prince that was promised?"""
"""He stands before you,"" Melisandre declared, ""though you do not have the eyes to see."
"Stannis 
Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the warrior of fire."
In him the prophecies are fulfilled.
"The red comet 
blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and he bears Lightbringer, the red sword of heroes."""
"Her words seemed to make the king desperately uncomfortable, Sam saw."
"Stannis ground his teeth, and 
said, ""You called and I came, my lords."
"Now you must live with me, or die with me."
"Best get used to 
that."""
He made a brusque gesture.
"""That's all."
"Maester, stay a moment."
"And you, Tarly."
"The rest of you 
may go."""
Me?
"Sam thought, stricken, as his brothers were bowing and making their way out."
"What does he want 
with me?"
"""You are the one that killed the creature in the snow,"" King Stannis said, when only the four of them 
remained."
"""Sam the Slayer."""
Melisandre smiled.
"Page 703

Sam felt his face turning red."
"""No, my lady."
Your Grace.
"I mean, I am, yes."
"I'm Samwell Tarly, yes."""
"""Your father is an able soldier,"" King Stannis said."
"""He defeated my brother once, at Ashford."
"Mace 
Tyrell has been pleased to claim the honors for that victory, but Lord Randyll had decided matters before 
Tyrell ever found the battlefield."
"He slew Lord Cafferen with that great Valyrian sword of his and sent his 
head to Aerys."""
The king rubbed his jaw with a finger.
"""You are not the sort of son I would expect such a 
man to have."""
"""I ..."
"I am not the sort of son he wanted, sire."""
"""if you had not taken the black, you would make a useful hostage,"" Stannis mused."
"""He has taken the black, sire,"" Maester Aemon pointed out."
"""I am well aware of that,"" the king said."
"""I am aware of more than you know, Aemon Targaryen."""
The old man inclined his head.
"""I am only Aemon, sire."
"We give up our House names when we forge our 
maester's chains."""
"The king gave that a curt nod, as if to say he knew and did not care."
"""You slew this creature with an 
obsidian dagger, I am told,"" he said to Sam."
"""Y-yes, Your Grace."
"Jon Snow gave it to me."""
"""Dragonglass."""
The red woman's laugh was music.
"""Frozen fire, in the tongue of old Valyria."
"Small 
wonder it is anathema to these cold children of the other."""
"""On Dragonstone, where I had my seat, there is much of this obsidian to be seen in the old tunnels 
beneath the mountain,"" the king told Sam."
"""Chunks of it, boulders, ledges."
"The great part of it was black, 
as I recall, but there was some green as well, some red, even purple."
"I have sent word to Ser Rolland my 
castellan to begin mining it."
"I will not hold Dragonstone for very much longer, I fear, but perhaps the Lord 
of Light shall grant us enough frozen f1re to arm ourselves against these creatures, before the castle falls."""
Sam cleared his throat.
"""S-sire."
"The dagger ... the dragonglass only shattered when I tried to stab a 
wight."""
Melisandre smiled.
"""Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh."
"Steel and fire 
will serve for them."
"The ones you call the Others are something more."""
"""Demons made of snow and ice and cold,"" said Stannis Baratheon."
"""The ancient enemy."
"The only enemy 
that matters."""
He considered Sam again.
"""I am told that you and this wildling girl passed beneath the 
Wall, through some magic gate."""
"""The B-black Gate,"" Sam stammered."
"""Below the Nightfort."""
"""The Nightfort is the largest and oldest of the castles on the Wall,"" the king said."
"""That is where I intend 
to make my seat, whilst I fight this war."
"You will show me this gate."""
"""I,"" said Sam, ""I w-will, if..."" If it is still there."
If it will open for a man not of the black.
If...
"Page 704

""You will,"" snapped Stannis."
"""I shall tell you when."""
Maester Aemon smiled.
"""Your Grace,"" he said, ""before we go, I wonder if you would do us the great 
honor of showing us this wondrous blade we have all heard so very much of."""
"""You want to see Lightbringer?"
"A blind man?"""
"""Sam shall be my eyes."""
The king frowned.
"""Everyone else has seen the thing, why not a blind man?"""
"His swordbelt and scabbard 
hung from a peg near the hearth."
He took the belt down and drew the longsword out.
"Steel scraped 
against wood and leather, and radiance filled the solar; shimmering, shifting, a dance of gold and orange 
and red light, all the bright colors of fire."
"""Tell me, Samwell."""
Maester Aemon touched his arm.
"""It glows,"" said Sam, in a hushed voice."
"""As if it were on fire."
"There are no flames, but the steel is yellow 
and red and orange, all flashing and glimmering, like sunshine on water, but prettier."
"I wish you could see 
it, Maester."""
"""I see it now, Sam."
A sword full of sunlight.
"So lovely to behold."""
The old man bowed stiffly.
"""Your 
Grace."
My lady.
"This was most kind of you. """
"When King Stannis sheathed the shining sword, the room seemed to grow very dark, despite the sunlight 
streaming through the window."
"""Very well, you've seen it."
You may return to your duties now.
"And 
remember what I said."
"Your brothers will chose a Lord Commander tonight, or I shall make them wish 
they had."""
Maester Aemon was lost in thought as Sam helped him down the narrow turnpike stair.
"But as they 
were crossing the yard, he said, ""I felt no heat."
"Did you, Sam?"""
"""Heat?"
"From the sword? """
He thought back.
"""The air around it was shimmering, the way it does above a 
hot brazier."""
"""Yet you felt no heat, did you?"
"And the scabbard that held this sword, it is wood and leather, yes?"
"I 
heard the sound when His Grace drew out the blade."
"Was the leather scorched, Sam?"
"Did the wood 
seem burnt or blackened? """
"""No,"" Sam admitted."
"""Not that I could see."""
Maester Aemon nodded.
"Back in his own chambers, he asked Sam to set a fire and help him to his chair 
beside the hearth."
"""it is hard to be so old,"" he sighed as he settled onto the cushion."
"""And harder still to be 
so blind."
I miss the sun.
And books.
"I miss books most of all."""
Aemon waved a hand.
"""I shall have no 
more need of you till the choosing."""
"""The choosing ... Maester, isn't there something you could do?"
What the king said of Lord Janos .
.
". """
"""I recall,"" Maester Aemon said, ""but Sam, I am a maester, chained and sworn."
"My duty is to counsel the 
Lord Commander, whoever he might be."
"It would not be proper for me to be seen to favor one 
contender over another."""
"Page 705

""I'm not a maester,"" said Sam."
"""Could I do something?"""
"Aemon turned his blind white eyes toward Sam's face, and smiled softy."
"""Why, I don't know, Samwell."
"Could you?"""
"I could, Sam thought."
I have to.
"He had to do it right away, too."
"If he 
hesitated he was certain to lose his courage."
"I am a man of the Night's Watch, he reminded himself as he 
hurried across the yard."
I am.
I can do this.
"There had been a time when he had quaked and squeaked if 
Lord Mormont so much as looked at him, but that was the old Sam, before the Fist of the First Men and 
Craster's Keep, before the wights and Coldhands, and the Other on his dead horse."
He was braver now.
"Gilly made me braver, he'd told Jon."
It was true.
It had to be true.
"Cotter Pyke was the scarier of the two commanders, so Sam went to him first, while his courage was 
still hot."
"He found him in the old Shieldhall, dicing with three of his Eastwatch men and a red-headed 
sergeant who had come from Dragonstone with Stannis."
"When Sam begged leave to speak with him, though, Pyke barked an order, and the others took the dice 
and coins and left them."
"No man would ever call Cotter Pyke handsome, though the body under his studded brigantine and 
roughspun breeches was lean and hard and wiry strong."
"His eyes were small and close-set, his nose 
broken, his widow's peak as sharply pointed as the head of a spear."
"The pox had ravaged his face badly, 
and the beard he'd grown to hide the scars was thin and scraggly."
"""Sam the Slayer!"""
"he said, by way of greeting."
"""Are you sure you stabbed an Other, and not some child's 
snow knight?"""
This isn't starting well.
"""it was the dragonglass that killed it, my lord,"" Sam explained feebly."
"""Aye, no doubt."
"Well, out with it, Slayer."
"Did the maester send you to me?"""
"""The maester?"""
Sam swallowed.
"""I ..."
"I just left him, my lord."""
"That wasn't truly a lie, but if Pyke chose to 
read it wrong, it might make him more inclined to listen."
"Sam took a deep breath and launched into his 
plea."
Pyke cut him off before he'd said twenty words.
"""You want me to kneel down and kiss the hem of 
Mallister's pretty cloak, is that it?"
I might have known.
You lordlings all flock like sheep.
"Well, tell 
Aemon that he's wasted your breath and my time."
if anyone withdraws it should be Mallister.
"The man's 
too bloody old for the job, maybe you ought to go tell him that."
"We choose him, and we're like to be 
back here in a year, choosing someone else."""
"""He's old,"" Sam agreed, ""but he's well ex-experienced."""
"""At sitting in his tower and fussing over maps, maybe."
"What does he plan to do, write letters to the 
wights?"
"He's a knight, well and good, but he's not a fighter, and I don't give a kettle of piss who he 
unhorsed in some fool tourney fifty years ago."
"The Halfhand fought all his battles, even an old blind man 
should see that."
And we need a fighter more than ever with this bloody king on top of us.
"Today it's ruins 
and empty fields, 
well and good, but what will His Grace want come the morrow?"
"You think Mallister has the belly to 
Page 706

stand up to Stannis Baratheon and that red bitch?"""
He laughed.
"""I don't."""
"""You won't support him, then?"""
"said Sam, dismayed."
"""Are you Sam the Slayer or Deaf Dick?"
"No, I won't support him."""
Pyke jabbed a finger at his face.
"""Understand this, boy."
"I don't want the bloody job, and never did."
"I fight best with a deck beneath me, 
not a horse, and Castle Black is too far from the sea."
"But I'll be buggered with a red-hot sword before I 
turn the Night's Watch over to that preening eagle from the Shadow Tower."
"And you can run back to the 
old man and tell him I said so, if he asks."""
He stood.
"""Get out of my sight."""
"It took all the courage Sam had left in him to say, ""W-what if there was someone else?"
"Could you 
s-support someone else?"""
"""Who?"
Bowen Marsh?
The man counts spoons.
"Othell's a follower, does what he's told and does it 
well, but no more'n that."
"Slynt ... well, his men like him, I'll grant you, and it would almost be worth it to 
stick him down the royal craw and see if Stannis gagged, but no."
"There's too much of King's Landing in 
that one."
"A toad grows wings and thinks he's a bloody dragon."""
Pyke laughed.
"""Who does that leave, 
Hobb?"
"We could pick him, I suppose, only then who's going to boil your mutton, Slayer?"
"You look like 
a man who likes his bloody mutton."""
There was nothing more to say.
"Defeated, Sam could only stammer out his thanks and take his leave."
"I 
will do better with Ser Denys, he tried to tell himself as he walked through the castle."
"Ser Denys was a 
knight, highborn and well-spoken, and he had treated Sam most courteously when he'd found him and 
Gilly on the road."
"Ser Denys will listen to me, he has to."
"The commander of the Shadow Tower had been born beneath the Booming Tower of Seagard, and 
looked every inch a Mallister."
"Sable trimmed his collar and accented the sleeves of his black velvet 
doublet."
A silver eagle fastened its claws in the gathered folds of his cloak.
"His beard was white as snow, 
his hair was largely gone, and his face was deeply lined, it was true."
"Yet he still had grace in his 
movements and teeth in his mouth, and the years had dimmed neither his blue-grey eyes nor his courtesy."
"""My lord of Tarly,"" he said, when his steward brought Sam to him in the Lance, where the Shadow 
Tower men were staying."
"""I am pleased to see that you've recovered from your ordeal."
"Might I offer you 
a cup of wine?"
"Your lady mother is a Florent, I recall."
"One day I must tell you about the time I unhorsed 
both of your grandfathers in the same tourney."
"Not today, though, I know we have more pressing 
concerns."
"You come from Maester Aemon, to be sure."
"Does he have counsel to offer me?"""
"Sam took a sip of wine, and chose his words with care."
"""A maester 
chained and sworn ... it would not be proper for him to be seen as having influenced the choice of Lord 
Commander."
.
". """
The old knight smiled.
"""Which is why he has not come to me himself."
"Yes, I quite understand, Samwell."
"Aemon and I are both old men, and wise in such matters."
"Say what you came to say."""
"The wine was sweet, and Ser Denys listened to Sam's plea with grave courtesy, unlike Cotter Pyke."
"But 
when he was done, the old knight shook his head."
"""I agree that it would be a dark day in our history if a 
king were to name our Lord Commander."
This king especially.
He is not like to keep his crown for long.
"But truly, Samwell, it ought to be Pyke who withdraws."
"I have more support than he does, and I am 
better suited to the office."""
"Page 707

""You are,"" Sam agreed, ""but Cotter Pyke might serve."
"It's said he has oft proved himself in battle."""
"He 
did not mean to offend Ser Denys by praising his rival, but how else could he convince him to withdraw?"
"""Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle."
It is not enough.
"Some matters cannot be 
settled with a battleaxe."
"Maester Aemon will understand that, though Cotter Pyke does not."
"The Lord 
Commander of the Night's Watch is a lord, first and foremost."
"He must be able to treat with other lords 
... and with kings as well."
"He must be a man worthy of respect."""
Ser Denys leaned forward.
"""We are the 
sons of great lords, you and I."
"We know the importance of birth, blood, and that early training that can 
ne'er be replaced."
"I was a squire at twelve, a knight at eighteen, a champion at two-and-twenty."
"I have 
been the commander at the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years."
"Blood, birth, and training have fitted 
me to deal with kings."
"Pyke ... well, did you hear him this morning, asking if His Grace would wipe his 
bottom?"
"Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank ... the ironborn 
are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy."
"Maester Harmune reads and writes his letters, and has for years."
"No, loath as I am to disappoint 
Maester Aemon, I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch."""
This time Sam was ready.
"""Might you for someone else?"
"If it was someone more suitable?"""
Ser Denys considered a moment.
"""I have never desired the honor for its own sake."
"At the last choosing, 
I stepped aside gratefully when Lord Mormont's name was offered, just as I had for Lord Qorgyle at the 
choosing before that."
"So long as the Night's Watch remains in good hands, I am content."
"But Bowen 
Marsh is not equal to the task, no more than Othell Yarwyck."
"And this so-called Lord of Harrenhal is a 
butcher's whelp upjumped by the Lannisters."
"Small wonder he is venal and corrupt."""
"""There's another man,"" Sam blurted out."
"""Lord Commander Mormont trusted him."
"So did Donal Noye 
and Qhorin Halfhand."
"Though he's not as highly born as you, he comes from old blood."
"He was 
castle-born and castle-raised, and he learned sword and lance from a knight and letters from a maester 
of the Citadel."
"His father was a lord, and his brother a king."""
Ser Denys stroked his long white beard.
"""Mayhaps,"" he said, after a long moment."
"""He is very young, 
but ... mayhaps."
"He might serve, I grant you, though I would be more suitable."
I have no doubt of that.
"I 
would be the wiser choice."""
"Ion said there could be honor in a lie, if it were told for the right reason."
"Sam said, ""If we do not choose 
a Lord Commander tonight, King Stannis means to name Cotter Pyke."
"He said as much to Maester 
Aemon this morning, after all of you had left."""
"""I see."""
Ser Denys rose.
"""I must think on this."
"Thank you, Samwell."
"And give my thanks to Maester 
Aemon as well."""
Sam was trembling by the time he left the Lance.
What have I done?
he thought.
What have I said?
"If 
they caught him in his lie, they would ... what?"
Send me to the Wall?
Rip my entrails out?
"Turn me into a 
wight?"
Suddenly it all seemed absurd.
"How could he be so frightened of Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys 
Mallister, when he had seen a raven eating Small Paul's face?"
Pyke was not pleased by his return.
"""You again?"
"Make it quick, you are starting to annoy me."""
"""I only need a moment more,"" Sam promised."
"""You won't withdraw for Ser Denys, you said, but you 
might for someone else."""
"""Who is it this time, Slayer?"
"You?"""
"Page 708

""No."
A fighter.
"Donal Noye gave him the Wall when the wildlings came, and he was the Old Bear's 
squire."
"The only thing is, he's bastard-born."""
Cotter Pyke laughed.
"""Bloody hell."
"That would shove a spear up Mallister's arse, wouldn't it?"
"Might be 
worth it just for that."
"How bad could the boy be?"""
He snorted.
"""I'd be better, though."
"I'm what's needed, 
any fool can see that."""
"""Any fool,"" Sam agreed, ""even me."
"But ... well, I shouldn't be telling you, but ... King Stannis means to 
force Ser Denys on us, if we do not choose a man tonight."
"I heard him tell Maester Aemon that, after the 
rest of you were sent away."""
"Chapter 79 
JON 
Iron Emmett was a long, lanky young ranger whose endurance, strength, and swordsmanship were the 
pride of Eastwatch."
"Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore, and woke the next day 
covered with bruises, which was just the way he wanted it."
"He would never get any better going up 
against the likes of Satin and Horse, or even Grenn."
"Most days he gave as good as he got, Jon liked to think, but not today."
"He had hardly slept last night, 
and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt, dressed, and walked the top of the 
Wall till the sun came up, wrestling with Stannis Baratheon's offer."
"The lack of sleep was catching up with 
him now, and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard, driving him back on his heels with 
one long looping cut after another, and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure."
"Jon's arm had gone numb from the shock of impact, and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be 
growing heavier with every passing moment."
"He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his 
shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple."
"He staggered, his helm and head both 
ringing from the force of the blow."
For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.
"And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat 
in place of mail and plate."
"His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not 
iron Emmett."
"Every morning they had trained together, since they were big enough to walk; Snow and Stark, spinning 
and slashing about the wards of Winterfell, shouting and laughing, sometimes crying when there was no 
one else to see."
"They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes."
"""I'm Prince 
Aemon the Dragonknight,"" Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, ""Well, I'm Florian the Fool."""
"Or Robb would say, ""I'm the Young Dragon,"" and Jon would reply, ""I'm Ser Ryam Redwyne."""
That morning he called it first.
"""I'm Lord of Winterfell!"""
"he cried, as he had a hundred times before."
"only 
this time, this time, Robb had answered, ""You can't be Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born."
"My lady 
mother says you can't ever be the Lord of Winterfell."""
"Page 709

I thought I had forgotten that."
"Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he'd taken."
"in the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm."
"The ranger 
sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword 
six yards away."
"""Jon, enough,"" Halder was shouting, ""he's down, you disarmed him."
"Enough!"""
No.
Not enough.
Never enough.
Jon let his sword drop.
"""I'm sorry,"" he muttered."
"""Emmett, are you 
hurt?"""
Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off.
"""Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend, 
Lord Snow?"""
"It was said amiably, though."
"Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of 
swords."
"""Warrior defend me,"" he groaned, ""now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt."""
That was too much.
"Jon wrenched free of his friends and retreated to the armory, alone."
"His ears were 
still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt him."
He sat on the bench and buried his head in his hands.
Why am I so angry?
"he asked himself, but it was a stupid question."
Lord of Winterfell.
"I could be the 
Lord of Winterfell."
My father's heir.
"It was not Lord Eddard's face he saw floating before him, though; it was Lady Catelyn's."
"With her deep 
blue eyes and hard cold mouth, she looked a bit like Stannis."
"Iron, he thought, but brittle."
"She was 
looking at him the way she used to look at him at Winterfell, whenever he had bested Robb at swords or 
sums or most anything."
Who are you?
that look had always seemed to say.
This is not your place.
"Why 
are you here?"
"His friends were still out in the practice yard, but Jon was in no fit state to face them."
"He left the armory 
by the back, descending a steep flight of stone steps to the wormways, the tunnels that linked the castle's 
keeps and towers below the earth."
"It was short walk to the bathhouse, where he took a cold plunge to 
wash the sweat off and soaked in a hot stone tub."
"The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles 
and made 
him think of Winterfell's muddy pools, steaming and bubbling in the godswood."
"Winterfell, he thought."
"Theon left it burned and broken, but I could restore it."
"Surely his father would have wanted that, and 
Robb as well."
They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.
"You can't be the Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born, he heard Robb say again."
"And the stone kings 
were growling at him with granite tongues."
You do not belong here.
This is not your place.
"When Jon 
closed his eyes he saw the heart tree, with its pale limbs, red leaves, and solemn face."
"The weirwood was 
the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said ... but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that 
heart up by its ancient roots, and feed it to the red woman's hungry fire god."
"I have no right, he thought."
Winterfell belongs to the old gods.
The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black.
"""I don't know,"" a 
man was saying, in a voice thick with doubts."
"""Maybe if I knew the man better ... Lord Stannis didn't 
have much good to say of him, I'll tell you that."""
"""When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone?"""
"Ser Alliser's flinty voice was 
unmistakable."
"""If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander, we become his bannermen in all but 
Page 710

name."
"Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that, and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end."
"He's already beaten Stannis once, on the Blackwater."""
"""Lord Tywin favors Slynt,"" said Bowen Marsh, in a fretful, anxious voice."
"""I can show you his letter, 
Othell."
"'Our faithful friend and servant' he called him."""
"Jon Snow sat up suddenly, and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh."
"""My lords,"" he said with 
cold courtesy."
"""What are you doing here, bastard?"""
Thorne asked.
"""Bathing."
"But don't let me spoil your plotting."""
"Jon climbed from the water, dried, dressed, and left them 
to conspire."
"Outside, he found he had no idea where he was going."
"He walked past the shell of the Lord 
Commander's Tower, where once he'd saved the Old Bear from a dead man; past the spot where 
Ygritte had died with that sad smile on her face; past the King's Tower where he and Satin and Deaf 
Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and his Thenns; past the heaped and charred remains of the 
great wooden stair."
"The inner gate was open, so Jon went down the tunnel, through the Wall."
"He could 
feel the cold around him, the weight of all the ice above his head."
"He walked past the place where Donal 
Noye and Mag the Mighty had fought and died together, through the new outer gate, and back into the 
pale cold sunlight."
"Only then did he permit himself to stop, to take a breath, to think."
Othell.
"Yarwyck was not a man of 
strong convictions, except when it 
came to wood and stone and mortar."
The Old Bear had known that.
"Thorne and Marsh will sway him, 
Yarwyck will support Lord Janos, and Lord Janos will be chosen Lord Commander."
"And what does 
that leave me, if not Winterfell?"
"A wind swirled against the Wall, tugging at his cloak."
"He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way 
heat comes off a fire."
Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again.
"The afternoon was growing old, 
and the sun was low in the west."
"A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined 
his wildling captives within a ring of ditches, sharpened stakes, and high wooden fences."
"To his left were 
three great firepits, where the victors had burned the bodies of all the free folk to die beneath the Wall, 
Page 711

huge pelted giants and little Hornfoot men alike."
"The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched 
weeds and hardened pitch, but Mance's people had left traces of themselves everywhere; a torn hide that 
might have been part of a tent, a giant's maul, the wheel of a chariot, a broken spear, a pile of mammoth 
dung."
"On the edge of the haunted forest, where the tents had been, Jon found an oakwood stump and 
sat."
Ygritte wanted me to be a wildling.
Stannis wants me to be the Lord of Winterfell.
But what do I want?
The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where it curved through the western hills.
"Jon 
watched as that towering expanse of ice took on the reds and pinks of sunset."
"Would I sooner be hanged 
for a tumcloak by Lord Janos, or forswear my vows, marry Val, and become the Lord of Winterfell?"
"It 
seemed an easy choice when he thought of it in those terms ... though if Ygritte had still been alive, it 
might have been even easier."
Val was a stranger to him.
"She was not hard on the eyes, certainly, and she 
had been sister to Mance Rayder's queen, but still ..."
"I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, but she might give me children."
"I might someday hold a 
son of my own blood in my arms."
"A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he 
decided to live his life on the Wall."
I could name him Robb.
"Val would want to keep her sister's son, but 
we could foster him at Winterfell, and Gilly's boy as well."
Sam would never need to tell his lie.
"We'd find 
a place for Gilly too, and Sam could come visit her once a year or so."
"Mance's son and Craster's would 
grow up brothers, as I once did with Robb."
"He wanted it, Jon knew then."
He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything.
"I have always 
wanted it, he thought, guiltily."
May the gods forgive me.
"it was a hunger inside him, sharp as a 
dragonglass blade."
A hunger ... he could feel it.
"It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank of fear 
or a great elk proud and defiant."
He needed to kill and fill his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood.
His mouth began to water with the thought.
it was a long moment before he understood what was happening.
"When he did, he bolted to his feet."
"""Ghost?"""
"He turned toward the wood, and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the 
breath coming warm and white from his open jaws."
"""Ghost!"""
"he shouted, and the direwolf broke into a 
run."
"He was leaner than he had been, but bigger as well, and the only sound he made was the soft crunch 
of dead leaves beneath his paws."
"When he reached Jon he leapt, and they wrestled amidst brown grass 
and long shadows as the stars came out above them."
"""Gods, wolf, where have you been?"""
"Jon said when 
Ghost stopped worrying at his forearm."
"""I thought you'd died on me, like Robb and Ygritte and all the 
rest."
"I've had no sense of you, not since I climbed the Wall, not even in dreams."""
"The direwolf had no 
answer, but he licked Jon's face with a tongue like a wet rasp, and his eyes caught the last light and shone 
like two great red suns."
"Red eyes, Jon realized, but not like Melisandre's."
He had a weirwood's eyes.
"Red eyes, red mouth, 
white fur."
"Blood and bone, like a heart tree."
"He belongs to the old gods, this one."
"And he alone of all the 
direwolves was white."
"Six pups they'd found in the late summer snows, him and Robb; five that were 
Page 712

grey and black and brown, for the five Starks, and one white, as white as Snow."
He had his answer then.
"Beneath the Wall, the queen's men were kindling their nightfire."
"He saw Melisandre emerge from the 
tunnel with the king beside her, to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away."
"""Come, 
Ghost,"" Jon told the wolf."
"""With me."
"You're hungry, I know."
"I could feel it."""
"They ran together for the 
gate, circling wide around the nightfire, where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night."
The king's men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black.
"They stopped as Jon went by, and 
gaped at him."
"None of them had ever seen a direwolf before, he realized, and Ghost was twice as large 
as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods."
"As he walked toward the armory, Jon 
chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window."
"I'm sorry, he thought."
"I'm not the man to 
steal you out of there."
in the practice yard he came upon a dozen king's men with torches and long spears in their hands.
"Their 
sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled, and a couple of his men lowered their spears until the knight who 
led them said, ""Move aside and let them pass."""
"To Jon he said, ""You're late for your supper."""
"""Then get out of my way, ser,"" Jon replied, and he did."
"He could hear the noise even before he reached the bottom of the steps; raised voices, curses, someone 
pounding on a table."
Jon stepped into the vault all but unnoticed.
"His brothers crowded the benches and 
the tables, but more were standing and shouting than were sitting, and no one was eating."
"There was no 
food."
What's happening here?
"Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about tumcloaks and treason, Iron 
Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist, Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from 
the Shadow Tower ... some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again, demanding 
quiet, but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling."
Pyp was the first to see Jon.
"He grinned at the sight of Ghost, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled 
as only a mummer's boy could whistle."
The shrill sound cut through the clamor like a sword.
"As Jon 
walked toward the tables, more of the brothers took note, and fell quiet."
"A hush spread across the cellar, 
until the only sounds were Jon's heels clicking on the stone floor, and the soft crackle of the logs in the 
hearth."
"Page 713

Ser Alliser Thorne shattered the silence."
"""The tumcloak graces us with his presence at last."""
Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering.
"""The beast,"" he gasped."
"""Look!"
"The beast that tore the life 
from Halfhand."
"A warg walks among us, brothers."
A WARG!
This ... this creature is not fit to lead us!
"This beastling is not fit to live!"""
"Ghost bared his teeth, but Jon put a hand on his head."
"""My lord,"" he said, ""will you tell me what's 
happened here?"""
"Maester Aemon answered, from the far end of the hall."
"""Your name has been put forth as Lord 
Commander, Jon."""
That was so absurd Jon had to smile.
"""By who?"""
"he said, looking for his friends."
"This had to be one of 
Pyp's japes, surely."
"But Pyp shrugged at him, and Grerm shook his head."
"It was Dolorous Edd Tollett 
who stood."
"""By me."
"Aye, it's a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend, but better you than me."""
Lord Janos started sputtering again.
"""This, this is an outrage."
We ought to hang this boy.
Yes!
"Hang him, 
I say, hang him for a tumcloak and a warg, along with his friend Mance Rayder."
Lord Commander?
"I will 
not have it, I will not suffer it!"""
Cotter Pyke stood up.
"""You won't suffer it?"
"Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your 
bloody arse, but you're wearing a black cloak now."""
"""Any brother may offer any name for our consideration, so long as the man has said his vows,"" Ser 
Denys Mallister said."
"""Tollett is well within his rights, my lord."""
"A dozen men started to talk at once, each trying to drown out the others, and before long half the hall 
was shouting once more."
"This time it was Ser Alliser Thorne who leapt up on the table, and raised his 
hands for quiet."
"""Brothers!"""
"he cried, ""this gains us naught."
I say we vote.
"This king who has taken the 
King's Tower has posted men at all the doors to 
Page 714

see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice."
So be it!
"We will choose, and choose again, 
all night if need be, until we have our lord ... but before we cast our tokens, I believe our First Builder has 
something to say to us."""
"Othell Yarwyck stood up slowly, frowning."
"The big builder rubbed his long lantern jaw and said, ""Well, 
I'm pulling my name out."
"If you wanted me, you had ten chances to choose me, and you didn't."
"Not 
enough of you, anyway."
"I was going to say that those who were casting a token for me ought to choose 
Lord Janos ."
.
". """
Ser Alliser nodded.
"""Lord Slynt is the best possible 
""I wasn't done, Alliser,"" Yarwyck complained."
"""Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King's 
Landing, we all know, and he was Lord of Harrenhal ."
.
". """
"""He's never seen Harrenhal,"" Cotter Pyke shouted out."
"""Well, that's so,"" said Yarwyck."
"""Anyway, now that I'm standing here, I don't recall why I thought Slynt 
would be such a good choice."
"That would be sort of kicking King Stannis in the mouth, and I don't see 
how that serves us."
Might be Snow would be better.
"He's been longer on the Wall, he's Ben Stark's 
nephew, and he served the Old Bear as squire."""
Yarwyck shrugged.
"""Pick who you want, just so it's not 
me."""
He sat down.
"Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple, Jon saw, but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale."
"The 
Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again, but now he was shouting for the kettle."
"Some of 
his friends took up the cry."
"""Kettle!"""
"they roared, as one."
"""Kettle, kettle, KETTLE!"""
"The kettle was in the comer by the hearth, a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a 
heavy lid."
"Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and 
dragged the kettle over to the table."
"A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels 
as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot."
"With a raucous scream and a clap of wings, 
a huge raven burst out of the kettle."
"It flapped upward, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make 
its escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either."
The raven was trapped.
"Cawing 
loudly, it circled the hall, once, twice, three times."
"And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout, ""I know that bird!"
"That's Lord Mormont's raven!"""
"Page 715

The raven landed on the table nearest Jon."
"""Snow,"" it cawed."
"it was an old bird, dirty and bedraggled."
"""Snow,"" it said again, ""Snow, snow, snow"" It walked to the end of the table, spread its wings again, and 
flew to Jon's shoulder."
"Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump, but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking 
laughter."
"""Ser Piggy thinks we're all fools, brothers,"" he said."
"""He's taught the bird this little trick."
"They all 
say 
snow, go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves."
"Mormont's bird had more words than that."""
The raven cocked its head and looked at Jon.
"""Corn?"""
it said hopefully.
"When it got neither corn nor 
answer, it quorked and muttered, ""Kettle?"
Kettle?
"Kettle?"""
"The rest was arrowheads, a torrent of arrowheads, a flood of arrowheads, arrowheads enough to 
drown the last few stones and shells, and all the copper pennies too."
"When the count was done, Jon found himself surrounded."
"Some clapped him on the back, whilst others 
bent the knee to him as if he were a lord in truth."
"Satin, Owen the Oaf, Halder, Toad, Spare Boot, Giant, 
Mully, Ulmer of the Kingswood, Sweet Donnel Hill, and half a hundred more pressed around him."
"Dywen clacked his wooden teeth and said, ""Gods be good, our Lord Commander's still in swaddling 
clothes."""
"Iron Emmett said, ""I hope this don't mean I can't beat the bloody piss out of you next time we 
train, my lord."""
"Three-Finger Hobb wanted to know if he'd still be eating with the men, or if he'd want his 
meals sent up to his solar."
"Even Bowen Marsh came up to say he would be glad to continue as Lord 
Steward if that was Lord Snow's wish."
"""Lord Snow,"" said Cotter Pyke, ""if you muck this up, I'm going to rip your liver out and eat it raw with 
onions."""
Ser Denys Mallister was more courteous.
"""It was a hard thing young Samwell asked of me,"" the old 
knight confessed."
"""When Lord Qorgyle was chosen, I told myself, 'No matter, he has been longer on the 
Wall than you have, your time will come.'"
"When it was Lord Mormont, I thought, 'He is strong and 
fierce, but he is old, your time may yet come.'"
"But you are half a boy, Lord Snow, and now I must return 
to the Shadow Tower knowing that my time will never come."""
He smiled a tired smile.
"""Do not make me 
die regretful."
Your uncle was a great man.
Your lord father and his father as well.
"I shall expect full as 
much of you."""
"Page 716

""Aye,"" said Cotter Pyke."
"""And you can start by telling those king's men that it's done, and we want our 
bloody supper."""
"""Supper,"" screamed the raven."
"""Supper, supper."""
"The king's men cleared the door when they told them of the choosing, and Three-Finger Hobb and half a 
dozen helpers went trotting off to the kitchen to fetch the food."
Jon did not wait to eat.
"He walked across 
the castle, wondering if he were dreaming, with the raven on his shoulder and Ghost at his heels."
"Pyp, 
Grenn, and Sam trailed after him, chattering, but he hardly heard a word until Grenn whispered, ""Sam did 
it,"" and Pyp said, ""Sam did it!"""
"Pyp had brought a wineskin with him, and he took a long drink and 
chanted, ""Sam, Sam, Sam the wizard, Sam the wonder, Sam Sam the marvel man, he did it."
"But when 
did you hide the raven in the kettle, Sam, and how in seven hells could you be certain it 
would fly to Jon?"
"It would have mucked up everything if the bird had decided to perch on Janos Slynt's 
fat head., 
""I had nothing to do with the bird,"" Sam insisted."
"""When it flew out of the kettle I almost wet myself."""
"Jon laughed, half amazed that he still remembered how."
"""You're all a bunch of mad fools, do you know 
that?"""
"""Us?"""
said Pyp.
"""You call us fools?"
"We're not the ones who got chosen as the 
nine-hundredth-and-ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
"You best have some wine, 
Lord Jon."
"I think you're going to need a lot of wine."""
So Jon Snow took the wineskin from his hand and had a swallow.
But only one.
"The Wall was his, the 
night was dark, and he had a king to face."
"Chapter 80 
SANSA 
Page 717

She awoke all at once, every nerve atingle."
For a moment she did not remember where she was.
"She 
had dreamt that she was little, still sharing a bedchamber with her sister Arya."
"But it was her maid she 
heard tossing in sleep, not her sister, and this was not Winterfell, but the Eyrie."
"And I am Alayne Stone, a 
bastard girl."
"The room was cold and black, though she was warm beneath the blankets."
"Dawn had not 
yet come."
"Sometimes she dreamed of Ser Ilyn Payne and woke with her heart thumping, but this dream 
had not been like that."
Home.
It was a dream of home.
The Eyrie was no home.
"It was no bigger than Maegor's Holdfast, and outside its sheer white walls was 
only the mountain and the long treacherous descent past Sky and Snow and Stone to the Gates of the 
Moon on the valley floor."
There was no place to go and little to do.
"The older servants said these halls 
rang with laughter when her father and Robert Baratheon had been Jon Arryn's wards, but those days 
were many years gone."
"Her aunt kept a small household, and seldom permitted any guests to ascend past 
the Gates of the Moon."
"Aside from her aged maid, Sansa's only companion was the Lord Robert, eight 
going on three."
And Marillion.
There is always Marillion.
"When he played for them at supper, the young singer often 
seemed to be singing directly at her."
Her aunt was far from pleased.
"Lady Lysa doted on Marillion, and 
had banished two serving girls and even a page for telling lies about him."
Lysa was as lonely as she was.
"Her new husband seemed to spend more time at the foot of the mountain 
than he did atop it."
"He was gone now, had been gone the past four days, meeting with the Corbrays."
"From 
bits and pieces of overheard conversations Sansa knew that Jon Arryn's bannermen resented Lysa's 
marriage and begrudged Petyr his authority as Lord Protector of the Vale."
"The senior branch of House 
Royce was close to open revolt over her aunt's failure to aid Robb in his war, and the Waynwoods, 
Redforts, Belmores, and Templetons were giving them every support."
"The mountain clans were being 
troublesome as well, and old Lord Hunter had died so suddenly that his two younger sons were accusing 
their elder brother of having murdered him."
"The Vale of Arryn might have been spared the worst of the 
war, but it was hardly the idyllic place that Lady Lysa had made it out to be."
"I am not going back to sleep, Sansa realized."
My head is all a tumult.
"She pushed her pillow away 
reluctantly, threw back the blankets, went to her window, and opened the shutters."
"Page 718

Snow was falling on the Eyrie."
Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory.
Was this what woke me?
"Already the 
snowfall lay thick upon the garden below, blanketing the grass, dusting the shrubs and statues with white 
and weighing down the branches of the trees."
"The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago, in the 
long summer of her childhood."
She had last seen snow the day she'd left Winterfell.
"That was a lighter fall than this, she remembered."
"Robb had melting flakes in his hair when he hugged me, and the snowball Arya tried to make kept 
coming apart in her hands."
It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning.
"Hullen had helped 
her mount, and she'd ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her, off to see the great wide world."
"I thought my song was beginning that day, but it was almost done."
Sansa left the shutters open as she dressed.
"It would be cold, she knew, though the Eyrie's towers 
encircled the garden and protected it from the worst of the mountain winds."
"She donned silken 
smallclothes and a linen shift, and over that a warm dress of blue lambswool."
"Two pairs of hose for her 
legs, boots that laced up to her knees, heavy leather gloves, and finally a hooded cloak of soft white fox 
fur."
Her maid rolled herself more tightly in her blanket as the snow began to drift in the window.
"Sansa eased 
open the door, and made her way down the winding stair."
"When she opened the door to the garden, it 
was so lovely that she held her breath, unwilling to disturb such perfect beauty."
"The snow drifted down 
and down, all in ghostly silence, and lay thick and unbroken on the ground."
"All color had fled the world 
outside."
It was a place of whites and blacks and greys.
"White towers and white snow and white statues, 
black shadows and black trees, the dark grey sky above."
"A pure world, Sansa thought."
"I do not belong 
here."
Yet she stepped out all the same.
"Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the 
snow, yet made no sound."
"Sansa drifted 
past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still dreaming."
"Drifting snowflakes 
brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks."
"At the center of the garden, beside 
the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to 
the sky and closed her eyes."
"She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips."
"It was the taste of 
Winterfell."
The taste of innocence.
The taste of dreams.
"When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees."
She did not remember falling.
"it seemed to 
Page 719

her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey."
"Dawn, she thought."
Another day.
Another new day.
"It was 
the old days she hungered for."
Prayed for.
But who could she pray to?
"The garden had been meant for a 
godswood once, she knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root."
"A 
godswood without gods, as empty as me."
She scooped up a handful of snow and squeezed it between her fingers.
"Heavy and wet, the snow 
packed easily."
"Sansa began to make snowballs, shaping and smoothing them until they were round and 
white and perfect."
"She remembered a summer's snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed 
her as she emerged from the keep one morning."
"They'd each had a dozen snowballs to hand, and she'd 
had none."
"Bran had been perched on the roof of the covered bridge, out of reach, but Sansa had chased 
Arya through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were breathless."
"She might even have 
caught her, but she'd slipped on some ice."
Her sister came back to see if she was hurt.
"When she said 
she wasn't, Arya hit her in the face with another snowball, but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her 
down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing."
What do I want with snowballs?
She looked at her sad little arsenal.
There's no one to throw them at.
She let the one she was making drop from her hand.
"I could build a snow knight instead, she thought."
"Or 
even ... 
She pushed two of her snowballs together, added a third, packed more snow in around them, and 
patted the whole thing into the shape of a cylinder."
"When it was done, she stood it on end and used the 
tip of her little finger to poke holes in it for windows."
"The crenellations around the top took a little more 
care, but when they were done she had a tower."
"I need some walls now, Sansa thought, and then a 
keep."
She set to work.
The snow fell and the castle rose.
"Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer."
"Towers and 
turrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along the inside of the west wall."
"It was only a castle when she began, but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell."
"She found twigs 
and fallen branches beneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood."
"For 
the gravestones in 
the lichyard she used bits of bark."
"Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white, her hands were 
tingling, and her feet were soaked and cold, but she did not care."
The castle was all that mattered.
"Some 
things were hard to remember, but most came back to her easily, as if she had been there only yesterday."
"The Library Tower, with the steep stonework stair twisting about its exterior."
"The gatehouse, two huge 
bulwarks, the arched gate between them, crenellations all along the top ... 
And all the while the snow kept falling, piling up in drifts around her buildings as fast as she raised them."
"She was patting down the pitched roof of the Great Hall when she heard a voice, and looked up to see 
Page 720

her maid calling from her window."
Was my lady well?
Did she wish to break her fast?
"Sansa shook her 
head, and went back to shaping snow, adding a chimney to one end of the Great Hall, where the hearth 
would stand inside."
Dawn stole into her garden like a thief.
"The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs 
turned a dark green beneath their stoles of snow."
"A few servants came out and watched her for a time, 
but she paid them no mind and they soon went back inside where it was warmer."
"Sansa saw Lady Lysa 
gazing down from her balcony, wrapped up in a blue velvet robe trimmed with fox fur, but when she 
looked again her aunt was gone."
"Maester Colemon popped out of the rookery and peered down for a 
while, skinny and shivering but curious."
Her bridges kept falling down.
"There was a covered bridge between the armory and the main keep, and 
another that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower to the second floor of the rookery, but no matter 
how carefully she shaped them, they would not hold together."
"The third time one collapsed on her, she 
cursed aloud and sat back in helpless frustration."
"""Pack the snow around a stick, Sansa."""
"She did not know how long he had been watching her, or when he had returned from the Vale."
"""A 
stick?"""
she asked.
"""That will give it strength enough to stand, I'd think,"" Petyr said."
"""May I come into your castle, my lady?"""
Sansa was wary.
"""Don't break it."
Be .
.
.
"""."
.
"gentle?"""
He smiled.
"""Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me."
"It is Winterfell, is it not?"""
"""Yes,"" Sansa admitted."
He walked along outside the walls.
"""I used to dream of it, in those years after Cat went north with 
Eddard Stark."
"In my dreams it was ever a dark place, and cold."""
"Page 721

""No."
"It was always warm, even when it snowed."
"Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls 
to warm them, and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer."""
"She stood, 
towering over the great white castle."
"""I can't think how to do the glass roof over the gardens."""
"Littlefinger stroked his chin, where his beard had been before Lysa had asked him to shave it off."
"""The 
glass was locked in frames, no?"
Twigs are your answer.
"Peel them and cross them and use bark to tie 
them together into frames."
"I'll show you."""
"He moved through the garden, gathering up twigs and sticks 
and shaking the snow from them."
"When he had enough, he stepped over both walls with a single long 
stride and squatted on his heels in the middle of the yard."
"Sansa came closer to watch what he was 
doing."
"His hands were deft and sure, and before long he had a crisscrossing latticework of twigs, very 
like the one that roofed the glass gardens of Winterfell."
"""We will need to imagine the glass, to be sure,"" he 
said when he gave it to her."
"""This is just right,"" she said."
He touched her face.
"""And so is that."""
Sansa did not understand.
"""And so is what?"""
"""Your smile, my lady."
"Shall I make another for you?"""
"""If you would.,, 
""Nothing could please me more."""
"She raised the walls of the glass gardens while Littlefinger roofed them over, and when they were done 
with that he helped her extend the walls and build the guardshall."
"When she used sticks for the covered 
bridges, they stood, just as he had said they would."
"The First Keep was simple enough, an old round 
drum tower, but Sansa was stymied again when it came to putting the gargoyles around the top."
"Again he 
had the answer."
"""It's been snowing on your castle, my lady,"" he pointed out."
"""What do the gargoyles look 
like when they're covered with snow?"""
"Page 722

Sansa closed her eyes to see them in memory."
"""They're just white lumps."""
"""Well, then."
"Gargoyles are hard, but white lumps should be easy."""
And they were.
The Broken Tower was easier still.
"They made a tall tower together, kneeling side by side to roll it 
smooth, and when they'd raised it Sansa stuck her fingers through the top, grabbed a handful of snow, 
and flung it full in his face."
"Petyr yelped, as the snow slid down under his collar."
"""That was unchivalrously 
done, my lady."""
"""As was bringing me here, when you swore to take me home."""
"She wondered where this courage had come from, to speak to him so frankly."
"From Winterfell, she 
thought."
I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell.
His face grew serious.
"""Yes, I played you false in that ... and in one other thing as well."""
Sansa's stomach was aflutter.
"""What other thing?"""
"""I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle."
"I fear that was a lie as 
well."
"Something else would please me more."""
He stepped closer.
"""This."""
"Sansa tried to step back, but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her."
"Feebly, she 
tried to squirm, but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him."
"His mouth was on hers, 
swallowing her words."
He tasted of mint.
"For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss ... before she turned 
her face away and wrenched free."
"""What are you doing?"""
Petyr straightened his cloak.
"""Kissing a snow maid."""
"Page 723

""You're supposed to kiss her."""
"Sansa glanced up at Lysa's balcony, but it was empty now."
"""Your lady 
wife."""
"""I do."
"Lysa has no cause for complaint."""
He smiled.
"""I wish you could see yourself, my lady."
"You are so 
beautiful."
"You're crusted over with snow like some little bear cub, but your face is flushed and you can 
scarcely breathe."
How long have you been out here?
You must be very cold.
"Let me warm you, Sansa."
"Take off those gloves, give me your hands."""
"""I won't."""
"He sounded almost like Marillion, the night he'd gotten so drunk at the wedding."
"Only this time 
Lothor Brune would not appear to save her; Ser Lothor was Petyr's man."
"""You shouldn't kiss me."
"I might 
have been your own daughter."
.
". """
"""Might have been,"" he admitted, with a rueful smile."
"""But you're not, are you?"
"You are Eddard Stark's 
daughter, and Cat's."
"But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was, when she was 
your age."""
"""Petyr, please."""
Her voice sounded so weak.
"""Please."
"""A castle!"""
"The voice was loud, shrill, and childish."
Littleflnger turned away from her.
"""Lord Robert."""
"He sketched a 
bow."
"""Should you be out in the snow without your gloves?"""
"""Did you make the snow castle, Lord Littlefinger?"""
"""Alayne did most of it, my lord."""
"Sansa said, ""It's meant to be Winterfell."""
"""Winterfell?"""
"Robert was small for eight, a stick of a boy with splotchy skin and eyes that were always 
runny."
Under one arm he clutched the threadbare cloth doll he carried everywhere.
"Page 724

""Winterfell is the seat of House Stark,"" Sansa told her husband-to-be."
"""The great castle of the north."""
"""It's not so great."""
The boy knelt before the gatehouse.
"""Look, here comes a giant to knock it down."""
"He 
stood his doll in the snow and moved it jerkily."
"""Tromp tromp I'm a giant, I'm a giant,"" he chanted."
"""Ho 
ho ho, open yourgates or I'll mash them and smash them."""
"Swinging the doll by the legs, he knocked the 
top off one gatehouse tower and then the other."
It was more than Sansa could stand.
"""Robert, stop that."""
"Instead he 
swung the doll again, and a foot of wall exploded."
"She grabbed for his hand but she caught the doll 
instead."
There was a loud ripping sound as the thin cloth tore.
"Suddenly she had the doll's head, Robert 
had the legs and body, and the rag-and-sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow."
Lord Robert's mouth trembled.
"""You killed him,"" he wailed."
Then he began to shake.
"It started with no 
more than a little shivering, but within a few short heartbeats he had collapsed across the castle, his limbs 
flailing about violently."
White towers and snowy bridges shattered and fell on all sides.
"Sansa stood 
horrified, but Petyr Baelish seized her cousin's wrists and shouted for the maester."
"Guards and serving girls arrived within instants to help restrain the boy, Maester Colemon a short time 
later."
"Robert Arryn's shaking sickness was nothing new to the people of the Eyrie, and Lady Lysa had 
trained them all to come rushing at the boy's first cry."
"The maester held the little lord's head and gave him 
half a cup of dreamwine, murmuring soothing words."
"Slowly the violence of the fit seemed to ebb away, 
till nothing remained but a small shaking of the hands."
"""Help him to my chambers,"" Colemon told the 
guards."
"""A leeching will help calm him."""
"""It was my fault."""
Sansa showed them the doll's head.
"""I ripped his doll in two."
"I never meant to, but ."
.
". 
"""
"""His lordship was destroying the castle,"" said Petyr."
"""A giant,"" the boy whispered, weeping."
"""It wasn't me, it was a giant hurt the castle."
She killed him!
"I hate 
her!"
She's a bastard and I hate her!
"I don't want to be leeched!"""
"Page 725

""My lord, your blood needs thinning,"" said Maester Colemon."
"""It is the bad blood that makes you angry, 
and the rage that brings on the shaking."
"Come now."""
They led the boy away.
"My lord husband, Sansa thought, as she contemplated the ruins of Winterfell."
"The snow had stopped, and it was colder than before."
"She wondered if Lord Robert would shake all 
through their wedding."
At least loffrey was sound of body.
A mad rage seized hold of her.
"She picked up 
a broken branch and smashed the torn doll's head down on top of it, then pushed it down atop the 
shattered gatehouse of her snow castle."
"The servants looked aghast, but when Littlefinger saw what she'd 
done he laughed."
"""If the tales be true, that's not the first giant to end up with his head on Winterfell's 
walls."""
"""Those are only stories,"" she said, and left him there."
"Back in her bedchamber, Sansa took off her cloak and her wet boots and sat beside the fire."
"She had 
no doubt that she would be made to answer for Lord Robert's fit."
"Perhaps Lady Lysa Mll send me 
away."
"Her aunt was quick to banish anyone who displeased her, and nothing displeased her quite so 
much as people she suspected of mistreating her son."
Sansa would have welcomed banishment.
"The Gates of the Moon was much larger than the Eyrie, and 
livelier as well."
"Lord Nestor Royce seemed gruff and stem, but his daughter Myranda kept his castle for 
him, and everyone said how frolicsome she was."
"Even Sansa's supposed bastardy might not count too 
much against her below."
"One of King Robert's baseborn daughters was in service to Lord Nestor, and 
she and the Lady Myranda were said to be fast friends, as close as sisters."
I will tell my aunt that I don't want to marry Robert.
"Not even the High Septon himself could declare a 
woman married if she refused to say the vows."
"She wasn't a beggar, no matter what her aunt said."
"She 
was thirteen, a woman flowered and wed, the heir to Winterfell."
"Sansa felt sorry for her little cousin 
sometimes, but she could not imagine ever wanting to be his wife."
"I would sooner be married to Tyrion 
again."
"If Lady Lysa knew that, surely she'd send her away ... away from Robert's pouts and shakes and 
runny eyes, away from Marillion's lingering looks, away from Petyr's kisses."
I will tell her.
I will!
It was late that afternoon when Lady Lysa summoned her.
"Sansa had been marshaling her courage all 
day, but no sooner did Marillion appear at her door than all her doubts returned."
"""Lady Lysa requires 
your presence in the High Hall."""
"The singer's eyes undressed her as he spoke, but she was used to that."
"Page 726

Marillion was comely, there was no denying it; boyish and slender, with smooth skin, sandy hair, a 
charming smile."
"But he had made himself well hated in the Vale, by everyone but her aunt and little Lord 
Robert."
"To hear the servants talk, Sansa was not the first maid to suffer his advances, and the others had 
not had Lothor Brune to defend them."
But Lady Lysa would hear no complaints against him.
"Since 
coming to the Eyrie, the singer had become her favorite."
"He sang Lord Robert to sleep every night, and 
tweaked the noses of Lady Lysa's suitors with verses that made mock of their foibles."
"Her aunt had 
showered him with gold and gifts; costly clothes, a gold arm ring, a belt studded with moonstones, a fine 
horse."
She had even given him her late husband's favorite falcon.
"It all served to make Marillion 
unfailingly courteous in Lady Lysa's presence, and unfailingly arrogant outside it."
"""Thank you,"" Sansa told him stiffly."
"""I know the way."""
He would not leave.
"""My lady said to bring you."""
Bring me?
She did not like the sound of that.
"""Are you a guardsman now?"""
"Littlefinger had dismissed the 
Eyrie's captain of guards and put Ser Lothor Brune in his place."
"""Do you require guarding?"""
Marillion said lightly.
"""I am composing a new song, you should know."
"A 
song so sweet and sad it will melt even your frozen heart."
'The Roadside Rose/ I mean to call it.
"About a 
basebom girl so beautiful she bewitched every man who laid eyes upon her."""
"I am a Stark of Winterfell, she longed to tell him."
"Instead she nodded, and let him escort her down the 
tower steps and along a bridge."
The High Hall had been closed as long as she'd been at the Eyrie.
"Sansa 
wondered why her aunt had opened it."
"Normally she preferred the comfort of her solar, or the cozy 
warmth of Lord Arryn's audience chamber with its view of the waterfall."
"Two guards in sky-blue cloaks flanked the carved wooden doors of the High Hall, spears in hand."
"""No 
one is to enter so long as Alayne is with Lady Lysa,"" Marillion told them."
"""Aye."""
"The men let them pass, then crossed their spears."
"Marillion swung the doors shut and barred 
them with a third spear, longer and thicker than those the guards had bome."
Sansa felt a prickle of unease.
"""Why did you do that?"""
"Page 727

""My lady awaits you."""
She looked about uncertainly.
"Lady Lysa sat on the dais in a highbacked chair of carved weirwood, 
alone."
"To her right was a second chair, taller than her own, with a stack of blue cushions piled on the 
seat, but Lord Robert was not in it."
Sansa hoped he'd recovered.
"Marillion was not like to tell her, 
though."
Sansa walked down the blue silk carpet between rows of fluted pillars slim as lances.
"The floors and 
walls of the High Hall were made of milk-white marble veined with blue."
"Shafts of pale daylight slanted 
down through narrow arched windows along the eastern wall."
"Between the windows were torches, 
mounted in high iron sconces, but none of them was lit."
Her footsteps fell softly on the carpet.
"Outside the 
wind blew cold and lonely."
"Amidst so much white marble even the sunlight looked chilly, somehow ... though not half so chilly as her 
aunt."
"Lady Lysa had dressed in a gown of cream-colored velvet and a necklace of sapphires and 
moonstones."
"Her auburn hair had been done up in a thick braid, and fell across one shoulder."
"She sat in 
the high seat watching her niece approach, her face red and puffy beneath the paint and powder."
"On the 
wall behind her hung a huge banner, the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn in cream and blue."
"Sansa stopped before the dais, and curtsied."
"""My lady."
"You sent for me."""
"She could still hear the sound 
of the wind, and the soft chords Marillion was playing at the foot of the hall."
"""I saw what you did,"" the Lady Lysa said."
Sansa smoothed down the folds of her skirt.
"""I trust Lord Robert is better?"
I never meant to rip his doll.
"He was smashing my snow castle, I only..."" 
""Will you play the coy deceiver with me?"""
her aunt said.
"""I was not speaking of Robert's doll."
"I saw you 
kissing him."""
The High Hall seemed to grow a little colder.
The walls and floor and columns might have turned to ice.
"""He kissed me."""
"Page 728

Lysa's nostrils flared."
"""And why would he do that?"
He has a wife who loves him.
"A woman grown, not a 
little girl."
He has no need for the likes of you.
"Confess, child."
You threw yourself at him.
"That was the 
way of it."""
Sansa took a step backward.
"""That's not true."""
"""Where are you going?"
Are you afraid?
"Such wanton behavior must be punished, but I will not be hard 
on you."
"We keep a whipping boy for Robert, as is the custom in the Free Cities."
"His health is too delicate 
for him to bear the rod himself."
"I shall find some common girl to take your whipping, but first you must 
own up to what you've done."
"I cannot abide a liar, Alayne."""
"""I was building a snow castle,"" Sansa said."
"""Lord Petyr was helping me, and then he kissed me."
"That's 
what you saw."""
"""Have you no honor?"""
her aunt said sharply.
"""Or do you take me for a fool?"
"You do, don't you?"
"You 
take me for a fool."
Yes ' I see that now.
I am not a fool.
"You think you can have any man you want 
because you're young and beautiful."
Don't think I haven't seen the looks you give Marillion.
"I know 
everything that happens in the Eyrie, little lady."
"And I have known your like before, too."
"But you are 
mistaken if you think big eyes and strumpet's smiles will win you Petyr."
"He is mine."""
She rose to her feet.
"""They all tried to take him from me."
"My lord father, my husband, your mother ... Catelyn most of all."
"She 
liked to kiss my Petyr too, oh yes she did."""
Sansa retreated another step.
"""My mother?"""
"""Yes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn."
"Don't you think to play the 
innocent with me, you vile little liar."
"All those years in Riverrun, she played with Petyr as if he were her 
little toy."
"She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made his nights a torment."""
"""No."""
"My mother is dead, she wanted to shriek."
"She was your own sister, and she's dead."
"""She didn't."
"She wouldn't."""
"""How would you know?"
"Were you there?"""
"Lysa descended from the high seat, her skirts swirling."
"""Did 
you come with Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood, the time they visited to lay their feud before my 
Page 729

father?"
"Lord Bracken's singer played for us, and Catelyn danced six dances with Petyr that night, six, I 
counted."
"When the lords began to argue my father took them up to his audience chamber, so there was 
no one to stop us drinking."
"Edmure got drunk, young as he was ... and Petyr tried to kiss your mother, 
only she pushed him away."
She laughed at him.
"He looked so wounded I thought my heart would burst, 
and afterward he drank until he passed out at the table."
"Uncle Brynden carried him up to bed 
before my father could find him like that."
"But you remember none of it, do you?"""
"She looked down 
angrily."
"""Do you?"""
"Is she drunk, or mad?"
"""I was not born, my lady."""
"""You were not bom."
"But I was, so do not presume to tell what is true."
I know what is true.
"You kissed 
him!"""
"""He kissed me,"" Sansa insisted again."
"""I never wanted 
""Be quiet, I haven't given you leave to speak."
"You enticed him, just as your mother did that night in 
Riverrun, with her smiles and her dancing."
You think I could forget?
"That was the night I stole up to his 
bed to give him comfort."
"I bled, but it was the sweetest hurt."
"He told me he loved me then, but he called 
me Cat, just before he fell back to sleep."
"Even so, I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten."
"Your 
mother did not deserve him."
"She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon 
Stark."
I would have given him my favor.
I gave him everything.
He is mine now.
"Not Catelyn's and not 
yours."""
All of Sansa's resolve had withered in the face of her aunt's onslaught.
"Lysa Arryn was frightening her as 
much as Queen Cersei ever had."
"""He's yours, my lady,"" she said, trying to sound meek and contrite."
"""May I have your leave to go?"""
"""You may not."""
Her aunt's breath smelled of wine.
"""If you were anyone else, I would banish you."
"Send 
you down to Lord Nestor at the Gates of the Moon, or back to the Fingers."
"How would you like to 
spend your life on that bleak shore, surrounded by slatterns and sheep pellets?"
"That was what my father 
meant for Petyr."
"Everyone thought it was because of that stupid duel with Brandon Stark, but that wasn't 
so."
"Father said I ought to thank the gods that so great a lord as Jon Arryn was willing to take me soiled, 
but I knew it was only for the swords."
"I had to marry Jon, or my father would have turned me out as he 
did his brother, but it was Petyr I was meant for."
"I am telling you all this so you will understand how much 
we love each other, how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another."
"We made a baby together, 
a precious little baby."""
"Lysa put her hands flat against her belly, as if the child was still there."
"""When they 
Page 730

stole him from me, I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again."
"Jon wished to send 
my sweet Robert to Dragonstone, and that sot of a king would have given him to Cersei Lannister, but I 
never let them ... no more than I'll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger."
"Do you hear me, Alayne or Sansa or 
whatever you call yourself?"
"Do you hear what I am telling you?"""
"""Yes."
"I swear, I won't ever kiss him again, or ... or entice him."""
"Sansa thought that was what her aunt 
wanted to hear."
"""So you admit it now?"
"It was you, just as I thought."
"You are as wanton as your mother."""
"Lysa grabbed 
her by the wrist."
"""Come with me now."
"There is something I want to show you."""
"""You're hurting me."""
Sansa squirmed.
"""Please, Aunt Lysa, I haven't done anything."
"I swear it."""
Her aunt ignored her protests.
"""Marillion!"""
she shouted.
"""I need you, Marillion!"
"I need you!"""
"The singer had remained discreetly in the rear of the hall, but at Lady Arryn's shout he came at once."
"""My lady?"""
"""Play us a song."
"Play 'The False and the Fair.""'"
Marillions fingers brushed the strings.
"""The lord he came a-riding upon a rainy day, hey-nonny, 
hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey..."" 
Lady Lysa pulled at Sansa's arm."
"It was either walk or be dragged, so she chose to walk, halfway down 
the hall and between a pair of pillars, to a white weirwood door set in the marble wall."
"The door was 
firmly closed, with three heavy bronze bars to hold it in place, but Sansa could hear the wind outside 
worrying at its edges."
"When she saw the crescent moon carved in the wood, she planted her feet."
"""The 
Moon Door."""
She tried to yank free.
"""Why are you showing me the Moon Door?"""
"""You squeak like a mouse now, but you were bold enough in the garden, weren't you?"
"You were bold 
enough in the snow."""
"Page 731

""The lady sat a-sewing upon a rainy day,"" Marillion sang."
"""Heynonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."""
"""Open the door,"" Lysa commanded."
"""Open it, I say."
"You will do it, or I'll send for my guards."""
"She 
shoved Sansa forward."
"""Your mother was brave, at least."
"Lift off the bars."""
"If I do as she says, she will let me go."
"Sansa grabbed one of the bronze bars, yanked it loose, and 
tossed it down."
"The second bar clattered to the marble, then the third."
"She had barely touched the latch 
when the heavy wooden door flew inward and slammed back against the wall with a bang."
"Snow had 
piled up around the frame, and it all came blowing in at them, borne on a blast of cold air that left Sansa 
shivering."
"She tried to step backward, but her aunt was behind her."
"Lysa seized her by the wrist and put 
her other hand between her shoulder blades, propelling her forcefully toward the open door."
"Beyond was white sky, falling snow, and nothing else."
"""Look down,"" said Lady Lysa."
"""Look down."""
"She tried to wrench free, but her aunt's fingers were digging into her arm like claws."
"Lysa gave her 
another shove, and Sansa shrieked."
Her left foot broke through a crust of snow and knocked it loose.
"There was nothing in front of her but empty air, and a waycastle six hundred feet below clinging to the 
side of the mountain."
"""Don't!"""
Sansa screamed.
"""You're scaring me! """
"Behind her, Marillion was still 
playing his woodharp and singing, ""Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."""
"""Do you still want my leave to go?"
"Do you?"""
"""No."""
"Sansa planted her feet and tried to squirm backward, but her 
aunt did not budge."
"""Not this way."
"Please..."" She put a hand up, her fingers scrabbling at the doorframe, 
but she could not get a grip, and her feet were sliding on the wet marble floor."
"Lady Lysa pressed her 
forward inexorably."
Her aunt outweighed her by three stone.
"""The lady lay a-kissing, upon a mound of 
hay,"" Marillion was singing."
"Sansa twisted sideways, hysterical with fear, and one foot slipped out over 
the void."
She screamed.
"""Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."""
"The wind flapped her skirts up and bit 
at her bare legs with cold teeth."
She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks.
"Sansa flailed, found 
Lysa's thick auburn braid, and clutched it tight."
"""My hair!"""
her aunt shrieked.
"""Let go of my hair!"""
"She 
was shaking, sobbing."
They teetered on the edge.
"Far off, she heard the guards pounding on the door 
Page 732

with their spears, demanding to be let in."
Marillion broke off his song.
"""Lysa!"
"What's the meaning of this?"""
The shout cut through the sobs and heavy breathing.
"Footsteps 
echoed down the High Hall."
"""Get back from there!"
"Lysa, what are you doing?"""
"The guards were still 
beating at the door; Littlefinger had come in the back way, through the lords' entrance behind the dais."
"As Lysa turned, her grip loosened enough for Sansa to rip free."
"She stumbled to her knees, where Petyr 
Baelish saw her."
He stopped suddenly.
"""Alayne."
"What is the trouble here?"""
"""Her."""
Lady Lysa grabbed a handful of Sansa's hair.
"""She's the trouble."
"She kissed you."""
"""Tell her, "" Sansa begged."
"""Tell her we were just building a castle ."
.
.
"""Be quiet!"""
her aunt screamed.
"""I never gave you leave to speak."
"No one cares about your castle."""
"""She's a child, Lysa."
Cat's daughter.
"What did you think you were doing?"""
"""I was going to marry her to Robert!"
She has no gratitude.
No ... no decency.
You are not hers to kiss.
Not hers!
"I was teaching her a lesson, that was all."""
"""I see."""
He stroked his chin.
"""I think she understands now."
"Isn't that so, Alayne? """
"""Yes,"" sobbed Sansa."
"""I understand."""
"III don't want her here."""
Her aunt's eyes were shiny with tears.
"""Why did you bring her to the Vale, 
Petyr?"
This isn't her place.
"She doesn't belong here."""
"""We'll send her away, then."
"Back to King's Landing, if you like."""
He took a step toward them.
"""Let her 
up, now."
"Let her away from the door."""
"Page 733

""NO!"""
Lysa gave Sansa's head another wrench.
"Snow eddied around them, making their skirts snap 
noisily."
"""You can't want her."
You can't.
She's a stupid empty-headed little girl.
"She doesn't love you the 
way I have."
I've always loved you.
"I've proved it, haven't I?"""
"Tears ran down 
her aunt's puffy red face."
"""I gave you my maiden's gift."
"I would have given you a son too, but they 
murdered him with moon tea, with tansy and mint and wormwood, a spoon of honey and a drop of 
permyroyal."
"It wasn't me, I never knew, I only drank what Father gave me."
.
". """
"""That's past and done, Lysa."
"Lord Hoster's dead, and his old maester as well."""
Littlefinger moved closer.
"""Have you been at the wine again?"
You ought not to talk so much.
"We don't want Alayne to know more 
than she should, do we?"
"Or Marillion?"""
Lady Lysa ignored that.
"""Cat never gave you anything."
"It was me who got you your first post, who made 
Jon bring you to court so we could be close to one another."
"You promised me you would never forget 
that."""
"""Nor have 1."
"We're together, just as you always wanted, just as we always planned."
"just let go of 
Sansa's hair."
.
"."""
"""I won't!"
I saw you kissing in the snow.
She's just like her mother.
"Catelyn kissed you in the godswood, 
but she never meant it, she never wanted you."
Why did you love her best?
"It was me, it was always 
meeee!"""
"""I know, love."""
He took another step.
"""And I am here."
"All you need to do is take my hand, come on."""
He held it out to her.
"""There's no cause for all these tears."""
"""Tears, tears, tears,"" she sobbed hysterically."
"""No need for tears ... but that's not what you said in King's 
Landing."
"You told me to put the tears in Jon's wine, and I did."
"For Robert, and for us!"
"And I wrote 
Catelyn and told her the Lannisters had killed my lord husband, just as you said."
"That was so clever ... 
you were always clever, I told Father that, I said Petyr's so clever, he'll rise high, he will, he will, and he's 
sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly ... Why did you kiss her?"
Why?
"We're together 
now, we're together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss herrrrrr?"""
"""Lysa,"" Petyr sighed, ""after all the storms we've suffered, you should trust me better."
"I swear, I shall 
never leave your side again, for as long as we both shall live."""
"""Truly?"""
"she asked, weeping."
"""Oh, truly?"""
"""Truly."
"Now unhand the girl and come give me a kiss."""
"Lysa threw herself into Littlefinger's arms, sobbing."
"As they hugged, Sansa crawled from the Moon 
Door on hands and knees and wrapped her arms around the nearest pillar."
"She could feel her heart 
pounding."
There was snow in her hair and her right shoe was missing.
It must have fallen.
"She shuddered, 
and hugged the pillar tighter."
"Littlefinger let Lysa sob against his chest for a moment, then put his hands on her arms and kissed her 
lightly."
"""My sweet silly jealous wife,"" he said, chuckling."
"""I've only loved one woman, I promise you."""
"Page 734

Lysa Arryn smiled tremulously."
"""Only one?"
"Oh, Petyr, do you swear it?"
"Only one?"""
"""Only Cat."""
"He gave her a short, sharp shove."
"Lysa stumbled backward, her feet slipping on the wet marble."
And then she was gone.
"She never 
screamed."
For the longest time there was no sound but the wind.
"Marillion gasped, ""You ... you..."" 
The guards were shouting outside the door, pounding with the butts of their heavy spears."
"Lord Petyr 
pulled Sansa to her feet."
"""You're not hurt?"""
"When she shook her head, he said, ""Run let my guards in, 
then."
"Quick now, there's no time to lose."
"This singer's killed my lady wife."""
"Epilogue 
The road up to Oldstones went twice around the hill before reaching the summit."
"Overgrown and stony, 
it would have been slow going even in the best of times, and last night's snow had left it muddy as well."
"Snow in autumn in the riverlands, it's unnatural, Merrett thought gloomily."
"It had not been much of a 
snow, true; just enough to blanket the ground for a night."
"Most of it had started melting away as soon as 
the sun came up."
"Still, Merrett took it for a bad omen."
"Between rains, floods, fire, and war, they had lost 
two harvests and a good part of a third."
An early winter would mean famine all across the riverlands.
"A 
great many people would go hungry, and some of them would starve."
"Merrett only hoped he wouldn't be 
one of them."
"I may, though."
"With my luck, I just may."
I never did have any luck.
"Beneath the castle ruins, the lower slopes of the hill were so thickly forested that half a hundred outlaws 
could well have been lurking there."
They could be watching me even now.
"Merrett glanced about, and 
saw nothing but gorse, bracken, thistle, sedge, and blackberry bushes between the pines and grey-green 
sentinels."
Elsewhere skeletal elm and ash and scrub oaks choked the ground like weeds.
"He saw no 
outlaws, but that meant little."
Outlaws were better at hiding than honest men.
"Merrett hated the woods, if truth be told, and he hated outlaws even more."
"""Outlaws stole my life,"" he 
had been known to complain when in his cups."
"He was too often in his cups, his father said, often and 
loudly."
"Too true, he thought ruefully."
"You needed some sort of distinction in the Twins, else they were 
liable to forget you were alive, but a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle had done little to 
enhance his prospects, 
he'd found."
I once hoped to be the greatest knight who ever couched a lance.
"The gods took that away 
from me."
Why shouldn't I have a cup of wine from time to time?
It helps my headaches.
"Besides, my wife 
is a shrew, my father despises me, my children are worthless."
What do I have to stay sober for?
"He was sober now, though."
"Well, he'd had two horns of ale when he broke his fast, and a small cup of 
red when he set out, but that was just to keep his head from pounding."
"Merrett could feel the headache 
building behind his eyes, and he knew that if he gave it half a chance he would soon feel as if he had a 
thunderstorm raging between his ears."
"Sometimes his headaches got so bad that it even hurt too much to 
weep."
"Then all he could do was rest on his bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over his eyes, and 
curse his luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to him."
"Page 735

just thinking about it made him anxious."
He could no wise afford a headache now.
"If I bring Petyr back 
home safely, all my luck will change."
"He had the gold, all he needed to do was climb to the top of 
Oldstones, meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle, and make the exchange."
A simple ransom.
"Even 
he could not muck it up ... unless he got a headache, one so bad that it left him unable to ride."
"He was 
supposed to be at the ruins by sunset, not weeping in a huddle at the side of the road."
"Merrett rubbed 
two fingers against his temple."
"Once more around the hill, and there I am."
"When the message had come 
in and he had stepped forward to offer to carry the ransom, his father had squinted down and said, ""You, 
Merrett? """
"and started laughing through his nose, that hideous heh heh heh laugh of his."
"Merrett practically 
had to beg before they'd give him the bloody bag of gold."
Something moved in the underbrush along the side of the road.
"Merrett reined up hard and reached for 
his sword, but it was only a squirrel."
"""Stupid,"" he told himself, shoving the sword back in its scabbard 
without ever having gotten it out."
"""Outlaws don't have tails."
"Bloody hell, Merrett, get hold of yourself."""
His heart was thumping in his chest as if he were some green boy on his first campaign.
"As if this were the 
kingswood and it was the old Brotherhood I was going to face, not the lightning lord's sorry lot of 
brigands."
For a moment he was tempted to trot right back down the hill and find the nearest alehouse.
"That bag of gold would buy a lot of ale, enough for him to forget all about Petyr Pimple."
"Let them hang 
him, he brought this on himself."
"It's no more than he deserves, wandering off with some bloody camp 
follower like a stag in rut."
"His head had begun to pound; soft now, but he knew it would get worse."
"Merrett rubbed the bridge of 
his nose."
He really had no right to think so ill of Petyr.
I did the same myself when I was his age.
"In his 
case all it got him was a pox, but still, he shouldn't condemn."
"Whores 
did have charms, especially if you had a face like Petyr's."
"The poor lad had a wife, to be sure, but she 
was half the problem."
"Not only was she twice his age, but she was bedding his brother Walder too, if the 
talk was true."
"There was always lots of talk around the Twins, and only a little was ever true, but in this 
case Merrett believed it."
"Black Walder was a man who took what he wanted, even his brother's wife."
"He'd had Edwyn's wife too, that was common knowledge, Fair Walda had been known to slip into his 
bed from time to time, and some even said he'd known the seventh Lady Frey a deal better than he 
should have."
Small wonder he refused to marry.
"Why buy a cow when there were udders all around 
begging to be milked?"
"Cursing under his breath, Merrett jammed his heels into his horse's flanks and rode on up the hill."
"As 
tempting as it was to drink the gold away, he knew that if he didn't come back with Petyr Pimple, he had 
as well not come back at all."
Lord Walder would soon turn two-and-ninety.
"His ears had started to go, his eyes were almost gone, 
and his gout was so bad that he had to be carried everywhere."
"He could not possibly last much longer, all 
his sons agreed."
"And when he goes, everything will change, and not for the better."
"His father was 
querulous and stubborn, with an iron will and a wasp's tongue, but he did believe in taking care of his 
own."
"All of his own, even the ones who had displeased and disappointed him."
"Even the ones whose 
names he can't remember, Once he was gone, though ..."
"When Ser Stevron had been heir, that was one thing."
"The old man had been grooming Stevron for sixty 
years, and had pounded it into his head that blood was blood."
"But Stevron had died whilst campaigning 
with the Young Wolf in the west - ""of waiting, no doubt,"" Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven 
brought them the news - and his sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey."
"Stevron's son Ser 
Ryman stood to inherit now; a thick-witted, stubborn, greedy man."
"And after Ryman came his own sons, 
Edwyn and Black Walder, who were even worse."
"""Fortunately,"" Lame Lothar once said, ""they hate each 
other even more than they hate us."""
"Page 736

Merrett wasn't certain that was fortunate at all, and for that matter Lothar himself might be more 
dangerous than either of them."
"Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin's wedding, 
but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton, all the way down to which songs 
would be played."
"Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with, but Merrett would never be so 
foolish as to turn his back on him."
"In the Twins, you learned early that only full blood siblings could be 
trusted, and them not very far."
"It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died, and every daughter as well."
"The new Lord 
of the Crossing would doubtless 
keep on some of his uncles, nephews, and cousins at the Twins, the ones he happened to like or trust, or 
more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him."
"The rest of us he'll shove out to fend for 
ourselves."
The prospect worried Merrett more than words could say.
"He would be forty in less than three years, 
too old to take up the life of a hedge knight ... even if he'd been a knight, which as it happened he wasn't."
"He had no land, no wealth of his own."
"He owned the clothes on his back but not much else, not even the 
horse he was riding."
"He wasn't clever enough to be a maester, pious enough to be a septon, or savage 
enough to be a sellsword."
"The gods gave me no gift but birth, and they stinted me there."
"What good was 
it to be the son of a rich and powerful House if you were the ninth son?"
"When you took grandsons and 
great-grandsons into account, Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than he did of 
inheriting the Twins."
"I have no luck, he thought bitterly."
I have never had any bloody luck.
"He was a big man, broad around 
the chest and shoulders if only of middling height."
"in the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy, he 
knew, but when he'd been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen, his eldest full 
brother, who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey's brood."
"As a boy he'd 
been packed off to Crakehall to serve his mother's family as a page."
"When old Lord Sumner had made 
him a squire, everyone had assumed he would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years, but the 
outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans."
"While his fellow squire Jaime 
Lannister was covering himself in glory, Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower, then 
managed to get captured by a woman, the one called the White Fawn."
"Lord Sumner had ransomed him 
back from the outlaws, but in the very next fight he'd been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken 
his helm and left him insensible for a fortnight."
"Everyone gave him up for dead, they told him later."
"Merrett hadn't died, but his fighting days were done."
"Even the lightest blow to his head brought on 
blinding pain and reduced him to tears."
"Under these circumstances knighthood was out of the question, 
Lord Sumner told him, not unkindly."
"He was sent back to the Twins to face Lord Walder's poisonous 
disdain."
"After that, Merrett's luck had only grown worse."
"His father had managed to make a good marriage for 
him, somehow; he wed one of Lord Darry's daughters, back when the Darrys stood high in King Aerys's 
favor."
But it seemed as if he no sooner had deflowered his bride than Aerys lost his throne.
"Unlike the 
Freys, the Darrys had been prominent Targaryen loyalists, which cost them half their lands, most of their 
wealth, and almost all their power."
"As for his lady wife, she found him a great disappointment from the 
first, and insisted on popping out nothing but girls 
for years; three live ones, a stillbirth, and one that died in infancy before she finally produced a son."
"His 
eldest daughter had turned out to be a slut, his second a glutton."
"When Ami was caught in the stables 
with no fewer than three grooms, he'd been forced to marry her off to a bloody hedge knight."
"That 
Page 737

situation could not possibly get any worse, he'd thought.. ."
"until Ser Pate decided he could win renown by 
defeating Ser Gregor Clegane."
"Ami had come running back a widow, to Merrett's dismay and the 
undoubted delight of every stablehand in the Twins."
"Merrett had dared to hope that his luck was finally changing when Roose Bolton chose to wed his 
WaIda instead of one of her slimmer, comelier cousins."
"The Bolton alliance was important for House 
Frey and his daughter had helped secure it; he thought that must surely count for something."
"The old man 
had soon disabused him."
"""He picked her because she's fat,"" Lord Walder said."
"""You think Bolton gave a 
mummer's fart that she was your whelp?"
"Think he sat about thinking, 'Heh, Merrett Muttonhead, that's 
the very man I need for a good-father'?"
"Your Walda's a sow in silk, that's why he picked her, and I'm 
not like to thank you for it."
"We'd have had the same alliance at half the price if your little porkling put 
down her spoon from time to time."""
"The final humiliation had been delivered with a smile, when Lame Lothar had summoned him to discuss 
his role in Roslin's wedding."
"""We must each play our part, according to our gifts,"" his half-brother told 
him."
"""You shall have one task and one task only, Merrett, but I believe you are well suited to it."
"I want 
you to see to it that Greatjon Umber is so bloody drunk that he can hardly stand, let alone fight."""
And even that I failed at.
"He'd cozened the huge northman into drinking enough wine to kill any three 
normal men, yet after Roslin had been bedded the Greatjon still managed to snatch the sword of the first 
man to accost him and break his arm in the snatching."
"It had taken eight of them to get him into chains, 
and the effort had left two men wounded, one dead, and poor old Ser Leslyn Haigh short half a ear."
"When he couldn't fight with his hands any longer, Umber had fought with his teeth."
Merrett paused a moment and closed his eyes.
"His head was throbbing like that bloody drum they'd 
played at the wedding, and for a moment it was all he could do to stay in the saddle."
"I have to go on, he 
told himself."
"If he could bring back Petyr Pimple, surely it would put him in Ser Ryman's good graces."
"Petyr might be a whisker on the hapless side, but he wasn't as cold as Edwyn, nor as hot as Black 
Walder."
"The boy will be grateful for my part, and his father will see that I'm loyal, a man worth having 
about."
But only if he was there by sunset with the gold.
Merrett glanced at the sky.
"Right on time, He needed 
something to steady his hands."
"He pulled up the waterskin hung from his saddle, uncorked it, and took a 
long swallow."
"The wine was thick and sweet, so dark it was almost black, but gods it tasted good."
The curtain wall of Oldstones had once encircled the brow of the hill like the crown on a king's head.
"Only the foundation remained, and a few waist-high piles of crumbling stone spotted with lichen."
"Merrett 
rode along the line of the wall until he came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood."
"The 
ruins were more extensive here, and he had to dismount to lead his palfrey through them."
"In the west, the 
sun had vanished behind a bank of low clouds."
"Gorse and bracken covered the slopes, and once inside 
the vanished walls the weeds were chest high."
"Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked 
about warily, but saw no outlaws."
Could I have come on the wrong day?
"He stopped and rubbed his 
temples with his thumbs, but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind his eyes."
"Seven bloody hells ... 
From somewhere deep within the castle, faint music came drifting through the trees."
"Merrett found himself shivering, despite his cloak."
"He pulled open his waterskin and had another drink of 
wine."
"I could just get back on my horse, ride to Oldtown, and drink the gold away."
"No good ever came 
from dealing with outlaws."
"That vile little bitch Wenda had burned a fawn into the cheek of his arse while 
she had him captive."
No wonder his wife despised him.
I have to go through with this.
"Petyr Pimple might 
Page 738

be Lord of the Crossing one day, Edwyn has no sons and Black Walder's only got bastards."
"Petyr will 
remember who came to get him."
"He took another swallow, corked the skin up, and led his palfrey 
through broken stones, gorse, and thin wind-whipped trees, following the sounds to what had been the 
castle ward."
"Fallen leaves lay thick upon the ground, like soldiers after some great slaughter."
"A man in patched, faded 
greens was sitting crosslegged atop a weathered stone sepulcher, fingering the strings of a woodharp."
The music was soft and sad.
Merrett knew the song.
"High in the halls of the kings who are gone, fenny 
would dance with her ghosts ... 
""Get off there,"" Merrett said."
"""You're sitting on a king."""
"""Old Tristifer don't mind my bony arse."
"The Hammer of justice, they called him."
"Been a long while since 
he heard any new songs."""
The outlaw hopped down.
"Trim and slim, he had a narrow face and foxy 
features, but his mouth was so wide that his smile seemed to touch his ears."
"A few strands of thin brown 
hair were blowing across his brow."
"He pushed them back with his free hand and said, ""Do you 
remember me, my lord?"""
"""No."""
Merrett frowned.
"""Why would I?"""
"""I sang at your daughter's wedding."
"And passing well, I thought."
That Pate she married was a cousin.
We're all cousins in Sevenstreams.
"Didn't stop him from turning niggard when it was time to pay me."""
"He 
shrugged."
"""Why is it your lord father never has me play at the Twins?"
"Don't I make enough noise for his 
lordship?"
"He likes it loud, I have been hearing."""
"""You bring the gold?"""
"asked a harsher voice, behind him."
Merrett's throat was dry.
"Bloody outlaws, always hiding in the bushes."
"It had been the same in the 
kingswood."
"You'd think you'd caught five of them, and ten more would spring from nowhere."
"When he turned, they were all around him; an ill-favored gaggle of leathery old men and 
smooth-cheeked lads younger than Petyr Pimple, the lot of them clad in roughspun rags, boiled leather, 
and bits of dead men's armor."
"There was one woman with them, bundled up in a hooded cloak three 
times too big for her."
"Merrett was too flustered to count them, but there seemed to be a dozen at the 
least, maybe a score."
"""I asked a question."""
"The speaker was a big bearded man with crooked green teeth and a broken nose; 
taller than Merrett, though not so heavy in the belly."
"A halffielm covered his head, a patched yellow cloak 
his broad shoulders."
"""Where's our gold?"""
"""in my saddlebag."
"A hundred golden dragons."""
Merrett cleared his throat.
"""You'll get it when I see that 
Petyr - "" 
A squat one-eyed outlaw strode forward before he could finish, reached into the saddlebag bold as you 
please, and found the sack."
"Merrett started to grab him, then thought better of it."
"The outlaw opened the 
drawstring, removed a coin, and bit it."
"""Tastes right."""
He hefted the sack.
"""Feels right too."""
"They're going to take the gold and keep Petyr too, Merrett thought in sudden panic."
"""That's the whole 
ransom."
"All you asked for."""
His palms were sweating.
He wiped them on his breeches.
"""Which one of 
you is Beric Dondarrion? """
"Dondarrion had been a lord before he turned outlaw, he might still be a man 
Page 739

of honor."
"""Why, that would be me,"" said the one-eyed man."
"""You're a bloody liar, Jack,"" said the big bearded man in the yellow cloak."
"""It's my turn to be Lord 
Beric."""
"""Does that mean I have to be Thoros?"""
The singer laughed.
"""My lord, sad to say, Lord Beric was 
needed elsewhere."
"The times are troubled, and there are many battles to fight."
"But we'll sort you out just 
as he would, have no fear."""
Merrett had plenty of fear.
His head was pounding too.
Much more of this and he'd be sobbing.
"""You 
have your gold,"" he said."
"""Give me my nephew, and I'll be gone."""
"Petyr was actually more a great 
half-nephew, but there was no need to go into that."
"""He's in the godswood,"" said the man in the yellow cloak."
"""We'll take you to him."
"Notch, you hold his 
horse."""
Merrett handed over the bridle reluctantly.
"He did not see what other 
choice he had."
"""My water skin,"" he heard himself say."
"""A swallow of wine, to settle my - "" 
""We don't drink with your sort,"" yellow cloak said curtly."
"""It's this way."
"Follow me."""
"Leaves crunched beneath their heels, and every step sent a spike of pain through Merrett's temple."
"They 
walked in silence, the wind gusting around them."
"The last light of the setting sun was in his eyes as he 
clambered over the mossy hummocks that were all that remained of the keep."
"Behind was the 
godswood."
"Petyr Pimple was hanging from the limb of an oak, a noose tight around his long thin neck."
"His eyes 
bulged from a black face, staring down at Men rett accusingly."
"You came too late, they seemed to say."
But he hadn't.
He hadn't!
He had come when they told him.
"""You killed him,"" he croaked."
"""Sharp as a blade, this one,"" said the one-eyed man."
An aurochs was thundering through Merrett's head.
"Mother have mercy, he thought."
"""I brought the 
gold."""
"""That was good of you,"" said the singer amiably."
"""We'll see that it's put to good use."""
Merrett turned away from Petyr.
He could taste the bile in the back of his throat.
"""You ... you had no 
right."""
"""We had a rope,"" said yellow cloak."
"""That's right enough."""
Two of the outlaws seized Merrett's arms and bound them tight behind his back.
"He was too deep in 
shock to struggle."
"""No,"" was all he could manage."
"""I only came to ransom Petyr."
"You said if you had the 
gold by sunset he wouldn't be harmed..."" 
""Well,"" said the singer, ""you've got us there, my lord."
"That was a lie of sorts, as it happens."""
"Page 740

The one-eyed outlaw came forward with a long coil of hempen rope."
"He looped one end around 
Merrett's neck, pulled it tight, and tied a hard knot under his ear."
"The other end he threw over the limb of 
the oak."
The big man in the yellow cloak caught it.
"""What are you doing?"""
"Merrett knew how stupid that sounded, but he could not believe what was 
happening, even then."
"""You'd never dare hang a Frey."""
Yellow cloak laughed.
"""That other one, the pimply boy, he said the same thing."""
He doesn't mean it.
He cannot mean it.
"""My father will pay you."
"I'm worth a good ransom, more than 
Petyr, twice as much."""
The singer sighed.
"""Lord Walder might be half-blind and gouty, but he's not so stupid as to snap at the 
same bait twice."
"Next time he'll send a hundred swords instead of a hundred dragons, I fear."""
"""He will!"""
"Merrett tried to sound stem, but his voice betrayed him."
"""He'll send a thousand swords, and 
kill you all."""
"""He has to catch us first."""
The singer glanced up at poor Petyr.
"""And he can't hang us twice, now can 
he?"""
He drew a melancholy air from the strings of his woodharp.
"""Here now, don't soil yourself."
"All you 
need to do is answer me a question, and I'll tell them to let you go."""
Merrett would tell them anything if it meant his life.
"""What do you want to know?"
"I'll tell you true, I 
swear it."""
The outlaw gave him an encouraging smile.
"""Well, as it happens, we're looking for a dog that ran away."""
"""A dog?"""
Merrett was lost.
"""What kind of dog?"""
"""He answers to the name Sandor Clegane."
Thoros says he was making for the Twins.
"We found the 
ferrymen who took him across the Trident, and the poor sod he robbed on the kingsroad."
"Did you see 
him at the wedding, perchance?"""
"""The Red Wedding?"""
"Merrett's skull felt as if it were about to split, but he did his best to recall."
"There 
had been so much confusion, but surely someone would have mentioned Joffrey's dog sniffing round the 
Twins."
"""He wasn't in the castle."
"Not at the main feast ... he might have been at the bastard feast, or in the 
camps, but ... no, someone would have said ."
.
". """
"""He would have had a child with him,"" said the singer."
"""A skinny girl, about ten."
"Or perhaps a boy the 
same age."""
"""I don't think so,"" said Merrett."
"""Not that I knew."""
"""No?"
"Ah, that's a pity."
"Well, up you go."""
"""No,"" Merrett squealed loudly."
"""No, don't, I gave you your answer, you said you'd let me go."""
"""Seems to me that what I said was I'd tell them to let you go."""
The singer looked at yellow cloak.
"""Lem, 
let him go."""
"""Go bugger yourself,"" the big outlaw replied brusquely."
"Page 741

The singer gave Merrett a helpless shrug and began to play, ""The Day They Hanged Black Robin."""
"""Please."""
The last of Merrett's courage was running down his leg.
"""I've done you no harm."
"I brought the 
gold, the way you said."
I answered your question.
"I have children."""
"""That Young Wolf never will,"" said the one-eyed outlaw."
Merrett could hardly think for the pounding in his head.
"""He shamed us, the whole realm was laughing, 
we had to cleanse the stain on our honor."""
His father had said all that and more.
"""Maybe so."
"What do a bunch o' bloody peasants know about a lord's honor?"""
"Yellow cloak wrapped 
the end of the rope around his hand three times."
"""We know some about murder, though."""
"""Not murder."""
His voice was shrill.
"""It was vengeance, we had a right to our vengeance."
It was war.
"Aegon, we called him linglebell, a poor lackwit never hurt anyone, Lady Stark cut his throat."
"We lost half 
a 
hundred men in the camps."
"Ser Garse Goodbrook, Kyra's husband, and Ser Tytos, Jared's son ."
.
.
"someone smashed his head in with an axe ... Stark's direwolf killed four of our wolfhounds and tore the 
kennelmaster's arm off his shoulder, even after we'd filled him full of quarrels ."
.
". """
"""So you sewed his head on Robb Stark's neck after both o' them were dead,"" said yellow cloak."
"""My father did that."
All I did was drink.
"You wouldn't kill a man for drinking."""
"Merrett remembered 
something then, something that might be the saving of him."
"""They say Lord Beric always gives a man a 
trial, that he won't kill a man unless something's proved against him."
You can't prove anything against me.
"The Red Wedding was my father's work, and Ryman's and Lord Bolton's."
"Lothar rigged the tents to 
collapse and put the crossbowmen in the gallery with the musicians, Bastard Walder led the attack on the 
camps ... they're the ones you want, not me, I only drank some wine ... you have no witness."""
"""As it happens, you're wrong there."""
The singer turned to the hooded woman.
"""Milady?"""
"The outlaws parted as she came forward, saying no word."
"When she lowered her hood, something 
tightened inside Merrett's chest, and for a moment he could not breathe."
No.
"No, I saw her die."
"She was 
dead for a day and night before they stripped her naked and threw her body in the river."
"Raymund 
opened her throat from ear to ear."
She was dead.
"Her cloak and collar hid the gash his brother's blade had made, but her face was even worse than he 
remembered."
The flesh had gone pudding soft in the water and turned the color of curdled milk.
"Half her 
hair was gone and the rest had turned as white and brittle as a crone's."
"Beneath her ravaged scalp, her 
face was shredded skin and black blood where she had raked herself with her nails."
"But her eyes were 
the most terrible thing."
"Her eyes saw him, and they hated."
"""She don't speak,"" said the big man in the yellow cloak."
"""You bloody bastards cut her throat too deep 
for that."
"But she remembers."""
"He turned to the dead woman and said, ""What do you say, m'lady?"
"Was 
he part of it?"""
Lady Catelyn's eyes never left him.
She nodded.
"Merrett Frey opened his mouth to plead, but the noose choked off his words."
"His feet left the ground, 
Page 742

the rope cutting deep into the soft flesh beneath his chin."
"Up into the air he jerked, kicking and twisting, 
up and up and up."

"OTHER HOUSES GREAT AND SMALL 
HOUSE ARRYN 
The Arryns are descended from the Kings of Mountain and Vale, one of the oldest and purest lines of 
Andal nobility."
"House Arryn has taken no part in the War of the Five Kings, holding back its strength to 
protect the Vale of Arryn."
"The Arryn sigil is the moon-and-falcon, white, upon a sky-blue field."
"The 
Arryn words are As High As Honor."

"HOUSE FLORENT 
The Florents of Brightwater Keep are Tyrell bannermen, despite a superior claim to Highgarden by 
virtue of a blood tie to House Gardener, the old Kings of the Reach."
"At the outbreak of the War of the 
Five Kings, Lord Alester Florent followed the Tyrells in declaring for King Renly, but his brother Ser 
Axell chose King Stannis, whom he had served for years as castellan of Dragonstone."
"Their niece Selyse 
was and is King Stannis's queen."
"When Renly died at Storm's End, the Florents went over to Stannis 
with all their strength, the first of Renly's bannermen to do so."
"The sigil of House Florent shows a fox 
head in a circle of flowers."

"HOUSE FREY 
Powerful, wealthy, and numerous, the Freys are bannermen to House Tully, but they have not always 
been diligent in their duty."
"When Robert Baratheon met Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, the Freys did 
not arrive until the battle was done, and thereafter Lord Hoster Tully always called Lord Walder ""the 
Late Lord Frey."""
"It is also said of Walder Frey that he is the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could 
field an army out of his breeches."
"At the onset of the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark won Lord Walder's allegiance by pledging to 
wed one of his daughters or granddaughters."
"Two of Lord Walder's grandsons were sent to Winterfell to 
be fostered."

The Tyrells rose to power as stewards to the Kings of the Reach, whose domain included the fertile 
plains of the southwest from the Dornish marches and Blackwater Rush to the shores of the Sunset Sea."
"Through the female line, they claim descent from Garth Greenhand, gardener king of the First Men, who 
wore a crown of vines and flowers and made the land bloom."
"When Mern IX, last king of House 
Gardener, was slain on the Field of Fire, his steward Harlen Tyrell surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the 
Conqueror."
Aegon granted him the castle and dominion over the Reach.
"The Tyrell sigil is a golden rose 
on a grass-green field."
Their words are Growing Strong.
"Lord Mace Tyrell declared his support for Renly Baratheon at the onset of the War of the Five Kings,
