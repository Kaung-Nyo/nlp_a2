""Cersei ended that when she replaced Ser Barristan on grounds of age."
"A suitable gift to the Faith will 
persuade the High Septon to release you from your vows."
"Your sister was foolish to dismiss Selmy, 
admittedly, but now that she has opened the gates - "" 
""- someone needs to close them again."""
Jaime stood.
"""I am tired of having highborn women kicking pails 
of shit at me, Father."
"No one ever asked me if I wanted to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but it 
seems I am."
"I have a duty - "" 
""You do."""
Lord Tywin rose as well.
"""A duty to House Lannister."
You are the heir to Casterly Rock.
That is where you should be.
"Tornmen should accompany you, as your ward and squire."
"The Rock is 
where he'll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his mother."
"I mean to find a new husband 
for Cersei."
"Oberyn Martell perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten 
Highgarden."
And it is past time you were wed.
"The Tyrells are now insisting that Margaery be wed to 
Tommen, but if I were to offer you instead - "" 
""NO!"""
Jaime had heard all that he could stand.
"No, more than he could stand."
"He was sick of it, sick of 
lords and lies, sick of his father, his sister, sick of the whole bloody business."
"""No."
No.
No.
No.
No.
How many times must I say no before you'll hear it?
Oberyn Martell?
"The man's infamous, and not just 
for poisoning his sword."
"He has more bastards than Robert, and beds with boys as well."
"And if you think 
for one misbegotten moment that I would wed Joffrey's widow..."" 
""Lord Tyrell swears the girl's still maiden."""
"""She can die a maiden as far as I'm concerned."
"I don't want her, and I don't want your Rock!"""
"""You are my son - "" 
""I am a knight of the Kingsguard."
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard!
"And that's all I mean to be!"""
Firelight gleamed golden in the stiff whiskers that framed Lord Tywin's face.
"A vein pulsed in his neck, 
but he did not speak."
And did not speak.
And did not speak.
The strained silence went on until it was more than Jaime could endure.
"""Father ."
.
". """
he began.
"""You are not my son."""
Lord Tywin turned his face away.
"""You say you are the Lord Commander of the 
Kingsguard, and only that."
"Very well, ser."
"Go do your duty."""
"Chapter 63 
DAVOS 
Their voices rose like cinders, swirling up into purple evening sky."
"""Lead us from the darkness, 0 my 
Lord."
"Fill our hearts with fire, so we may walk your shining path."""
"The nightfire burned against the gathering dark, a great bright beast whose shifting orange light threw 
shadows twenty feet tall across the yard."
"All along the walls of Dragonstone the army of gargoyles and 
grotesques seemed to stir and shift."
"Page 559

Davos looked down from an arched window in the gallery above."
"He watched Melisandre lift her arms, 
as if to embrace the shivering flames."
"""WhIlor,"" she sang in a voice loud and clear, ""you are the light in 
our eyes, the fire in our hearts, the heat in our loins."
"Yours is the sun that warms our days, yours the stars 
that guard us in the dark of night."""
"""Lord of Light, defend us."
"The night is dark and full of terrors. """
"Queen Selyse led the responses, her 
pinched face full of fervor."
"King Stannis stood beside her, jaw clenched hard, the points of his red-gold 
crown shimmering whenever he moved his head."
"He is with them, but not of them, Davos thought."
"Princess Shireen was between them, the mottled grey patches on her face and neck almost black in the 
firelight."
"""Lord of Light, protect us,"" the queen sang."
The king did not respond with the others.
"He was staring 
into the flames."
Davos wondered what he saw there.
Another vision of the war to come?
"Or something 
closer to home?"
"""WhIlor who gave us breath, we thank you,"" sang Melisandre."
"""R'hllor who gave us day, we thank you."""
"""We thank you for the sun that warms us,"" Queen Selyse and the 
other worshipers replied."
"""We thank you for the stars that watch us."
"We thank you for our hearths and 
for our torches, that keep the savage dark at bay."""
"There were fewer voices saying the responses than 
there had been the night before, it seemed to Davos; fewer faces flushed with orange light about the fire."
But would there be fewer still on the morrow ... or more?
The voice of Ser Axell Florent rang loud as a trumpet.
"He stood barrelchested and bandy-legged, the 
firelight washing his face like a monstrous orange tongue."
"Davos wondered if Ser Axell would thank him, 
after."
"The work they did tonight might well make him the King's Hand, as he dreamed."
"Melisandre cried, ""We thank you for Stannis, by your grace our king."
"We thank you for the pure white 
fire of his goodness, for the red sword of justice in his hand, for the love he bears his leal people."
"Guide 
him and defend him, R'hllor, and grant him strength to smite his foes."""
"""Grant him strength,"" answered Queen Selyse, Ser Axell, Devan, and the rest."
"""Grant him courage."
"Grant him wisdom."""
"When he was a boy, the septons had taught Davos to pray to the Crone for wisdom, to the Warrior for 
courage, to the Smith for strength."
"But it was the Mother he prayed to now, to keep his sweet son Devan 
safe from the red woman's demon god."
"""Lord Davos?"
"We'd best be about it."""
Ser Andrew touched his elbow gently.
"""My lord?"""
"The title still rang queer in his ears, yet Davos turned away from the window."
"""Aye."
"It's time."""
"Stannis, 
Melisandre, and the queen's men would be at their prayers an hour or more."
"The red priests lit their fires 
every day at sunset, to thank R'hllor for the day just ending, and beg him to send his sun back on the 
morrow to banish the gathering darkness."
A smuggler must know the tides and when to seize them.
"That 
was all he was at the end of the day; Davos the smuggler."
"His maimed hand rose to his throat for his luck, 
and found nothing."
He snatched it down and walked a bit more quickly.
"His companions kept pace, matching their strides to his own."
"The Bastard of Nightsong had a 
pox-ravaged face and an air of tattered chivalry; Ser Gerald Gower was broad, bluff, and blond; Ser 
Page 560

Andrew Estermont stood a head taller, with a spade-shaped beard and shaggy brown eyebrows."
"They 
were all good men in their own ways, Davos thought."
"And they will all be dead men soon, if this night's 
work goes badly."
"""Fire is a living thing,"" the red woman told him, when he asked her to teach him how to see the future in 
the flames."
"""It is always moving, always changing ... like a book whose letters dance and shift even as 
you try to read them."
"It takes years of training to see the shapes beyond the flames, and more years still 
to learn to tell the shapes of what will 
be from what may be or what was."
"Even then it comes hard, hard."
"You do not understand that, you men 
of the sunset lands."""
"Davos asked her then how it was that Ser Axell had learned the trick of it so 
quickly, but to that she only smiled enigmatically and said, ""Any cat may stare into a fire and see red mice 
at play."""
"He had not lied to his king's men, about that or any of it."
"""The red woman may see what we intend,"" he 
warned them."
"""We should start by killing her, then,"" urged Lewys the Fishwife."
"""I know a place where we could 
waylay her, four of us with sharp swords ."
.
". """
"""You'd doom us all,"" said Davos."
"""Maester Cressen tried to kill her, and she knew at once."
"From her 
flames, I'd guess."
"It seems to me that she is very quick to sense any threat to her own person, but surely 
she cannot see everything."
"if we ignore her, perhaps we might escape her notice."""
"""There is no honor in hiding and sneaking,"" objected Ser Triston of Tally Hill, who had been a Sunglass 
man before Lord Guncer went to Melisandre's fires."
"""Is it so honorable to burn? """
Davos asked him.
"""You saw Lord Sunglass die."
is that what you want?
"I 
don't need men of honor now."
I need smugglers.
"Are you with me, or no?"""
They were.
"Gods be good, they were."
Maester Pylos was leading Edric Storm through his sums when Davos pushed open the door.
"Ser 
Andrew was close behind him; the others had been left to guard the steps and cellar door."
"The maester 
broke off."
"""That will be enough for now, Edric."""
The boy was puzzled by the intrusion.
"""Lord Davos, Ser Andrew."
"We were doing sums."""
Ser Andrew smiled.
"""I hated sums when I was your age, coz."""
"""I don't mind them so much."
"I like history best, though."
"it's full of tales."""
"""Edric,"" said Maester Pylos, ""run and get your cloak now."
"You're to go with Lord Davos."""
"""I am?"""
Edric got to his feet.
"""Where are we going?"""
His mouth set stubbornly.
"""I won't go pray to the 
Lord of Light."
"I am a Warrior's man, like my father."""
"""We know,"" Davos said."
"""Come, lad, we must not dawdle."""
Edric donned a thick hooded cloak of undyed wool.
"Maester Pylos helped him fasten it, and pulled the 
hood up to shadow his face."
"""Are you coming with us, Maester?"""
the boy asked.
"Page 561

""No."""
Pylos touched the chain of many metals he wore about his neck.
"""My place is here on 
Dragonstone."
"Go with Lord Davos now, and do as he says."
"He is the King's Hand, remember."
"What did 
I tell you about the King's Hand?"""
"""The Hand speaks with the king's voice."""
The young maester smiled.
"""That's so."
"Go now."""
Davos had been uncertain of Pylos.
Perhaps he resented him for taking old Cressen's place.
"But now he 
could only admire the man's courage."
This could mean his life as well.
"Outside the maester's chambers, Ser Gerald Gower waited by the steps."
"Edric Storm looked at him 
curiously."
"As they made their descent he asked, ""Where are we going, Lord Davos?"""
"""To the water."
"A ship awaits you."""
The boy stopped suddenly.
"""A ship?"""
"""One of Salladhor Saan's."
"Salla is a good friend of mine."""
"""I shall go with you, Cousin,"" Ser Andrew assured him."
"""There's nothing to be frightened of."""
"""I am not frightened,"" Edric said indignantly."
"""Only ... is Shireen coming too?"""
"""No,"" said Davos."
"""The princess must remain here with her father and mother."""
"""I have to see her then,"" Edric explained."
"""To say my farewells."
"Otherwise she'll be sad."""
Not so sad as if she sees you bum.
"""There is no time,"" Davos said."
"""I will tell the princess that you were 
thinking of her."
"And you can write her, when you get to where you're going."""
The boy frowned.
"""Are you sure I must go?"
Why would my uncle send me from Dragonstone?
"Did I 
displease him?"
"I never meant to."""
He got that stubborn look again.
"""I want to see my uncle."
"I want to see 
King Stannis."""
Ser Andrew and Ser Gerald exchanged a look.
"""There's no time for that, Cousin,"" Ser Andrew said."
"""I want to see him!"""
"Edric insisted, louder."
"""He does not want to see you."""
"Davos had to say something, to get the boy moving."
"""I am his Hand, I 
speak with his voice."
Must I go to the king and tell him that you would not do as you were told?
"Do you 
know how angry that will make him?"
"Have you ever seen your uncle angry?"""
"He pulled off his glove and 
showed the boy the four fingers that Stannis had shortened."
"""I have."""
"It was all lies; there had been no anger in Stannis Baratheon when he cut the ends off his onion knight's 
fingers, only an iron sense of justice."
"But Edric Storm had not been born then, and could not know that."
And the threat had the desired effect.
"""He should not have done that,"" the boy said, but he let Davos take 
him by the hand and draw him down the steps."
The Bastard of Nightsong joined them at the cellar door.
"They walked quickly, across a shadowed yard 
Page 562

and down some steps, under the stone 
tail of a frozen dragon."
"Lewys the Fishwife and Omer Blackberry waited at the postern gate, two guards 
bound and trussed at their feet."
"""The boat?"""
Davos asked them.
"""It's there,"" Lewys said."
"""Four oarsmen."
The galley is anchored just past the point.
"Mad Prendos."""
Davos chuckled.
A ship named after a madman.
"Yes, that's fitting."
"Salla had a streak of the pirate's 
black humor."
He went to one knee before Edric Storm.
"""I must leave you now,"" he said."
"""There's a boat waiting, to 
row you out to a galley."
Then it's off across the sea.
"You are Robert's son so I know you will be brave, 
no matter what happens."""
"""I will."
"Only..."" The boy hesitated."
"""Think of this as an adventure, my lord."""
Davos tried to sound hale and cheerful.
"""It's the start of your 
life's great adventure."
"May the Warrior defend you."""
"""And may the Father judge you justly, Lord Davos."""
"The boy went with his cousin Ser Andrew out the 
postern gate."
"The others followed, all but the Bastard of Nightsong."
"May the Father judge me justly, 
Davos thought ruefully."
But it was the king's judgment that concerned him now.
"""These two?"""
"asked Ser Rolland of the guards, when he had closed and barred the gate."
"""Drag them into a cellar,"" said Davos."
"""You can cut them free when Edric's safely under way."""
The Bastard gave a curt nod.
There were no more words to say; the easy part was done.
"Davos pulled 
his glove on, wishing he had not lost his luck."
"He had been a better man and a braver one with that bag of 
bones around his neck."
"He ran his shortened fingers through thinning brown hair, and wondered if it 
needed to be cut."
He must look presentable when he stood before the king.
Dragonstone had never seemed so dark and fearsome.
"He walked slowly, his footsteps echoing off 
black walls and dragons."
"Stone dragons who will never wake, I pray."
"The Stone Drum loomed huge 
ahead of him."
The guards at the door uncrossed their spears as he approached.
"Not for the onion knight, 
but for the King's Hand."
"Davos was the Hand going in, at least."
"He wondered what he would be coming 
out."
If I ever do ...
"The steps seemed longer and steeper than before, or perhaps it was just that he was tired."
"The Mother 
never made me for tasks like this."
"He had risen too high and too fast, and up here on the mountain the air 
was too thin for him to breathe."
"As a boy he'd dreamed of riches, but that was long ago."
"Later, grown, all 
he had wanted was a few acres of good land, a hall to grow old in, a better life for his sons."
"The Blind 
Bastard used to tell him that a clever smuggler did not overreach, nor draw too 
much attention to himself."
"A few acres, a timbered roof, a ""ser"" before my name, I should have been 
content."
"If he survived this night, he would take Devan and sail home to Cape Wrath and his gentle 
Marya."
"We will grieve together for our dead sons, raise the living ones to be good men, and speak no 
more of kings."
"The Chamber of the Painted Table was dark and empty when Davos entered; the king would still be at 
the nightfire, with Melisandre and the queen's men."
"He knelt and made a fire in the hearth, to drive the 
Page 563

chill from the round chamber and chase the shadows back into their corners."
"Then he went around the 
room to each window in turn, opening the heavy velvet curtains and unlatching the wooden shutters."
"The 
wind came in, strong with the smell of salt and sea, and pulled at his plain brown cloak."
"At the north window, he leaned against the sill for a breath of the cold night air, hoping to catch a 
glimpse of Mad Prendos raising sail, but the sea seemed black and empty as far as the eye could see."
"Is 
she gone already?"
"He could only pray that she was, and the boy with her."
"A half moon was sliding in and 
out amongst thin high clouds, and Davos could see familiar stars."
"There was the Galley, sailing west; there 
the Crone's Lantern, four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze."
"The clouds hid most of the Ice 
Dragon, all but the bright blue eye that marked due north."
The sky is full of smugglers' stars.
"They were 
old friends, those stars; Davos hoped that meant good luck."
"But when he lowered his gaze from the sky to the castle ramparts, he was not so certain."
"The wings of 
the stone dragons cast great black shadows in the light from the nightfire."
"He tried to tell himself that they 
were no more than carvings, cold and lifeless."
"This was their place, once."
"A place of dragons and 
dragonlords, the seat of House Targaryen."
The Targaryens were the blood of old Valyria ...
"The wind sighed through the chamber, and in the hearth the flames gusted and swirled."
"He listened to the 
logs crackle and spit."
"When Davos left the window his shadow went before him, tall and thin, and fell 
across the Painted Table like a sword."
"And there he stood for a long time, waiting."
"He heard their boots 
on the stone steps as they ascended."
The king's voice went before him.

"is not three,"" he was saying."
"""Three is three,"" came Melisandre's answer."
"""I swear to you, Your Grace, I saw him die and heard his 
mother's wail."""
"""In the nightfire."""
Stannis and Melisandre came through the door together.
"""The flames are full of tricks."
"What is, what will be, what may be."
You cannot tell me for a certainty.

"."""
"""Your Grace."""
Davos stepped forward.
"""Lady Melisandre saw it true."
"Your nephew Joffrey is dead."""
"If the king was surprised to find him at the Painted Table, he gave no 
sign."
"""Lord Davos,"" he said."
"""He was not my nephew."
"Though for years I believed he was."""
"""He choked on a morsel of food at his wedding feast,"" Davos said."
"""It may be that he was poisoned."""
"""He is the third,"" said Melisandre."
"""I can count, woman."""
"Stannis walked along the table, past Oldtown and the Arbor, up toward the 
Shield Islands and the mouth of the Mander."
"""Weddings have become more perilous than battles, it 
would seem."
Who was the poisoner?
"Is it known?"""
"""His uncle, it's said."
"The Imp."""
Stannis ground his teeth.
"""A dangerous man."
I learned that on the Blackwater.
"How do you come by this 
report?"""
"""The Lyseni still trade at King's Landing."
"Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me."""
"""I suppose not."""
The king ran his fingers across the table.
"""Joffrey ..."
"I remember once, this kitchen cat ... 
the cooks were wont to feed her scraps and fish heads."
"One told the boy that she had kittens in her belly, 
Page 564

thinking he might want one."
Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if it were true.
"When 
he found the kittens, he brought them to show to his father."
"Robert hit the boy so hard I thought he'd 
killed him."""
The king took off his crown and placed it on the table.
"""Dwarf or leech, this killer served the 
kingdom well."
"They must send for me now."""
"""They will not,"" said Melisandre."
"""Joffrey has a brother."""
"""Tommen."""
The king said the name grudgingly.
"""They will crown Tommen, and rule in his name."""
Stannis made a fist.
"""Tommen is gentler than Joffrey, but bom of the same incest."
"Another monster in the 
making."
Another leech upon the land.
"Westeros needs a man's hand, not a child's."""
Melisandre moved closer.
"""Save them, sire."
Let me wake the stone dragons.
Three is three.
"Give me the 
boy."""
"""Edric Storm,"" Davos said."
Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury.
"""I know his name."
Spare me your reproaches.
"I like this no more 
than you do, but my duty is to the realm."
My duty .
.
". """
He turned back to Melisandre.
"""You swear there 
is no other way?"
"Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie."""
"""You are he who must stand against the Other."
"The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand 
years ago."
The red comet was your herald.
"You are the prince that was promised, and if you fail the 
world fails with you."""
"Melisandre went to him, her red lips parted, her ruby throbbing."
"""Give me this boy,"" 
she whispered, ""and I will give you your kingdom."""
"""He can't,"" said Davos."
"""Edric Storm is gone."""
"""Gone?"""
Stannis turned.
"""What do you mean, gone?"""
"""He is aboard a Lyseni galley, safely out to sea."""
"Davos watched Melisandre's pale, heart-shaped face."
"He saw the flicker of dismay there, the sudden uncertainty."
She did not see it!
The king's eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of his face.
"""The bastard was taken from 
Dragonstone without my leave?"
"A galley, you say?"
"If that Lysene pirate thinks to use the boy to squeeze 
gold from me - "" 
""This is your Hand's work, sire."""
Melisandre gave Davos a knowing look.
"""You will bring him back, my 
lord."
"You will."""
"""The boy is out of my reach,"" said Davos."
"""And out of your reach as well, my lady."""
Her red eyes made him squirm.
"""I should have left you to the dark, ser."
"Do you know what you have 
done?"""
"""My duty."""
"""Some might call it treason."""
Stannis went to the window to stare out into the night.
"Is he looking for the 
ship?"
"""I raised you up from dirt, Davos."""
He sounded more tired than angry.
"""Was loyalty too much to 
Page 565

hope for?"""
"""Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater."
I might have died myself.
"You have my loyalty, 
always."""
"Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words he said next; he knew his life 
depended on them."
"""Your Grace, you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience, 
to defend your realm against your foes, to protect your people."
Is not Edric Storm one of your people?
One of those I swore to protect?
I kept my oath.
"How could that be treason?"""
Stannis ground his teeth again.
"""I never asked for this crown."
"Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so 
long as I am the king, I have a duty ..."
"If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the 
dark ... Sacrifice ... is never easy, Davos."
Or it is no true sacrifice.
"Tell him, my lady."""
"Melisandre said, ""Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart's blood of his own beloved wife."
"If a 
man with a thousand cows gives one to god, that is nothing."
"But a man who offers the only cow he owns 
."
.
". """
"""She talks of cows,"" Davos told the king."
"""I am speaking of a boy, your daughter's friend, your brother's 
son."""
"""A king's son, with the power of kingsblood in his veins."""
"Melisandre's ruby glowed like a red star at her 
throat."
"""Do you think you've saved this boy, Onion Knight?"
"When the long night falls, Edric Storm shall 
die with the rest, wherever he is hidden."
Your own sons as well.
Darkness and cold will cover the earth.
"You meddle in matters you do not understand."""
"""There's much I don't understand,"" Davos admitted."
"""I have never pretended elsewise."
"I know the seas 
and rivers, the shapes of the coasts, where the rocks and shoals lie."
"I know hidden coves where a boat 
can 
land unseen."
"And I know that a king protects his people, or he is no king at all."""
Stannis's face darkened.
"""Do you mock me to my face?"
"Must I learn a king's duty from an onion 
smuggler?"""
Davos knelt.
"""If I have offended, take my head."
"I'll die as I lived, your loyal man."
But hear me first.
"Hear 
me for the sake of the onions I brought you, and the fingers you took."""
Starmis slid Lightbringer from its scabbard.
Its glow filled the chamber.
"""Say what you will, but say it 
quickly."""
The muscles in the king's neck stood out like cords.
Davos fumbled inside his cloak and drew out the crinkled sheet of parchment.
"It seemed a thin and 
flimsy thing, yet it was all the shield he had."
"""A King's Hand should be able to read and write."
"Maester 
Pylos has been teaching me."""
"He smoothed the letter flat upon his knee and began to read by the light of 
the magic sword."
"Chapter 64 
JON 
Page 566

He dreamt he was back in Winterfell, limping past the stone kings on their thrones."
"Their grey granite 
eyes turned to follow him as he passed, and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted 
swords upon their laps."
"You are no Stark, he could hear them mutter, in heavy granite voices."
"There is no 
place for you here."
Go away.
He walked deeper into the darkness.
"""Father?"""
he called.
"""Bran?"
"Rickon?"""
No one answered.
A chill wind was blowing on his neck.
"""Uncle?"""
he called.
"""Uncle Benjen?"
Father?
"Please, Father, help me."""
Up above he heard drums.
"They are feasting in the Great Hall, but I am not 
welcome there."
"I am no Stark, and this is not my place."
His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees.
"The 
crypts were growing darker."
A light has gone out somewhere.
"""Ygritte?"""
he whispered.
"""Forgive me."
"Please."""
"But it was only a direwolf, grey and ghastly, spotted with blood, his golden eyes shining sadly 
through the dark ..."
"The cell was dark, the bed hard beneath him."
"His own bed, he remembered, his own bed in his 
steward's cell beneath the Old Bear's chambers."
By rights it should have brought him sweeter dreams.
"Even beneath the furs, he was cold."
"Ghost had shared his cell before the ranging, warming it against the 
chill of night."
"And in the wild, Ygritte had slept beside him."
"Both gone now He had burned Ygritte 
himself, as he knew she would have wanted, and Ghost ... Where are you?"
"Was he dead as well, was 
that what his dream had meant, the bloody wolf in the crypts?"
"But the wolf in the dream had been grey, 
not white."
"Grey, like Bran's wolf."
Had the Therms hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown?
"If so, Bran was lost to him for good and all."
Jon was trying to make sense of that when the horn blew.
"The Horn of Winter, he thought, still confused from sleep."
"But Mance never found Joramun's horn, so 
that couldn't be."
"A second blast followed, as long and deep as the first."
"Jon had to get up and go to the 
Wall, he knew, but it was so hard ..."
He shoved aside his furs and sat.
"The pain in his leg seemed duller, nothing he could not stand."
"He had 
slept in his breeches and tunic and smallclothes, for the added warmth, so he had only to pull on his boots 
and don leather and mail and cloak."
"The horn blew again, two long blasts, so he slung Longclaw over 
one shoulder, found his crutch, and hobbled down the steps."
"it was the black of night outside, bitter cold and overcast."
"His brothers were spilling out of towers and 
keeps, buckling their swordbelts and walking toward the Wall."
"Jon looked for Pyp and Grenn, but could 
not find them."
Perhaps one of them was the sentry blowing the horn.
"It is Mance, he thought."
"He has 
come at last."
That was good.
"We will fight a battle, and then we'll rest."
"Alive or dead, we'll rest."
"Where the stair had been, only an immense tangle of charred wood and broken ice remained below the 
Wall."
"The winch raised them up now, but the cage was only big enough for ten men at a time, and it was 
already on its way up by the time Jon arrived."
He would need to wait for its return.
"Others waited with 
him; Satin, Mully, Spare Boot, Kegs, big blond Hareth with his buck teeth."
"Everyone called him Horse, 
He had been a stablehand in Mole's Town, one of the few moles who had stayed at Castle Black."
"The 
rest had run back to their fields and hovels, or their beds in the underground brothel."
"Horse wanted to 
take the black, though, the great buck-toothed fool."
"Zei remained as well, the whore who'd proved so 
handy with a crossbow, and Noye had kept three orphan boys whose father had died on the steps."
"They 
were young - nine and eight and five - but no one else seemed to want them."
"As they waited for the cage to come back, Clydas brought them cups of hot mulled wine, while 
Three-Finger Hobb passed out chunks of black bread."
Jon took a heel from him and gnawed on it.
"""Is it Mance Rayder?"""
Satin asked anxiously.
"Page 567

""We can hope so."""
There were worse things than wildlings in the dark.
"Jon remembered the words the 
wildling king had spoken on the Fist of the First Men, as they stood amidst that pink snow."
"When the 
dead walk, walls and stakes and swords mean nothing."
"You cannot fight the dead, Jon Snow No man 
knows that half so well as me."
just thinking of it made the wind seem a little colder.
"Finally the cage came clanking back down, swaying at the end of the long chain, and they crowded in 
silently and shut the door."
Mully yanked the bell rope three times.
"A moment later they began to rise, by fits and starts at first, then 
more smoothly."
No one spoke.
At the top the cage swung sideways and they clambered out one by one.
Horse gave Jon a hand down onto the ice.
The cold hit him in the teeth like a fist.
"A line of fires burned along the top of the Wall, contained in iron baskets on poles taller than a man."
"The 
cold knife of the wind stirred and swirled the flames, so the lurid orange light was always shifting."
"Bundles 
of quarrels, arrows, spears, and scorpion bolts stood ready on every hand."
"Rocks were piled ten feet 
high, big wooden barrels of pitch and lamp oil lined up beside them."
"Bowen Marsh had left Castle Black 
well supplied in everything save men."
"The wind was whipping at the black cloaks of the scarecrow 
sentinels who stood along the ramparts, spears in hand."
"""I hope it wasn't one of them who blew the 
horn,"" Jon said to Donal Noye when he limped up beside him."
"""Did you hear that?"""
Noye asked.
"There was the wind, and horses, and something else."
"""A mammoth,"" Jon said."
"""That was a mammoth."""
"The armorer's breath was frosting as it blew from his broad, flat nose."
"North of the Wall was a sea of 
darkness that seemed to stretch forever."
"Jon could make out the faint red glimmer of distant fires moving 
through the wood."
"it was Mance, certain as sunrise."
The Others did not light torches.
"""How do we fight them if we can't see them?"""
Horse asked.
Donal Noye turned toward the two great trebuchets that Bowen Marsh had restored to working order.
"""Give me light!"""
he roared.
Barrels of pitch were loaded hastily into the slings and set afire with a torch.
"The wind fanned the flames 
to a brisk red fury."
"""NOW!"""
Noye bellowed.
"The counterweights plunged downward, the throwing arms 
rose to thud against the padded crossbars."
"The burning pitch went tumbling through the darkness, casting 
an eerie flickering light upon the ground below."
"Jon caught a glimpse of mammoths moving ponderously 
through the half-light, and just as quickly lost them again."
"A dozen, maybe more."
"The barrels struck the 
earth and burst."
"They heard a deep bass trumpeting, and a giant roared something in the Old Tongue, his 
voice an ancient thunder that sent shivers up Jon's spine."
"""Again!"""
"Noye shouted, and the trebuchets were loaded once more."
"Two more barrels of burning pitch 
went crackling through the gloom to come crashing down amongst the foe."
"This time one of them struck a 
dead tree, enveloping it in flame."
"Not a dozen mammoths, Jon saw, a hundred."
He stepped to the edge of the precipice.
"Careful, he reminded himself, 
it is a long way down."
"Red Alyn sounded his sentry's horn once more, 
Aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooooooooo, aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooo."
"And now the wildlings 
answered, not with one horn but with a dozen, and with drums and pipes as well."
"We are come, they 
Page 568

seemed to say, we are come to break your Wall, to take your lands and steal your daughters."
"The wind 
howled, the trebuchets creaked and thumped, the barrels flew."
"Behind the giants and the mammoths, Jon 
saw men advancing on the Wall with bows and axes."
Were there twenty or twenty thousand?
"In the dark 
there was no way to tell."
"This is a battle of blind men, but Mance has a few thousand more of them than 
we do."
"""The gate!"""
Pyp cried out.
"""They're at the GATE"" 
The Wall was too big to be stormed by any conventional means; too high for ladders or siege towers, 
too thick for battering rams."
"No catapult could throw a stone large enough to breach it, and if you tried to 
set it on fire, the icemelt would quench the flames."
"You could climb over, as the raiders did near 
Greyguard, but only if you were strong and fit and sure-handed, and even then you might end up like Jarl, 
impaled on a tree."
"They must take the gate, or they cannot pass."
"But the gate was a crooked tunnel through the ice, smaller than any castle gate in the Seven Kingdoms, 
so narrow that rangers must lead their garrons through single file."
"Three iron grates closed the inner 
passage, each locked and chained and protected by a murder hole."
"The outer door was old oak, nine 
inches thick and studded with iron, not easy to break through."
"But Mance has mammoths, he reminded 
himself, and giants as well."
"""Must be cold down there,"" said Noye."
"""What say we warm them up, lads?"""
"A dozen jars of lamp oil 
had been lined up on the precipice."
"PyP ran down the line with a torch, setting them alight."
"Owen the Oaf 
followed, shoving them over the edge one by one."
"Tongues of pale yellow fire swirled around the jars as 
they plunged downward."
"When the last was gone, Grenn kicked loose the chocks on a barrel of pitch 
and sent it rumbling and rolling over the edge as well."
"The sounds below changed to shouts and screams, 
sweet music to their ears."
"Yet still the drums beat on, the trebuchets shuddered and thumped, and the sound of skinpipes came 
wafting through the night like the songs of strange fierce birds."
"Septon Cellador began to sing as well, his 
voice tremulous and thick with wine."
"Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, we pray, 
stay the swords and stay the arrows, let them know... 
Donal Noye rounded on him."
"""Any man here stays his sword, I'll chuck his puckered arse right off this 
Wall ... starting with you, Septon."
Archers!
"Do we have any bloody archers?"""
"""Here,"" said Satin."
"""And here,"" said Mully."
"""But how can I find a target?"
It's black as the inside of a pig's belly.
"Where are 
they?"""
Noye pointed north.
"""Loose enough arrows, might be you'll find a few."
"At least you'll make them fretful."""
He looked around the ring of firelit faces.
"""I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if 
they break the gate."""
"More than ten stepped forward, and the smith picked his four."
"""Jon, you have the 
Wall till I return."""
For a moment Jon thought he had misheard.
It had sounded as if Noye were leaving him in command.
"""My lord?"""
"Page 569

""Lord?"
I'm a blacksmith.
"I said, the Wall is yours."""
"There are older men, Jon wanted to say, better men."
I am still as green as summer grass.
"I'm wounded, 
and I stand accused of desertion."
His mouth had gone bone dry.
"""Aye,"" he managed."
Afterward it would seem to Jon Snow as if he'd dreamt that night.
"Side by side with the straw soldiers, 
with longbows or crossbows clutched in half-frozen hands, his archers launched a hundred flights of 
arrows against men they never saw."
From time to time a wildling arrow came flying back in answer.
"He 
sent men to the smaller catapults and filled the air with jagged rocks the size of a giant's fist, but the 
darkness swallowed them as a man might swallow a handful of nuts."
"Mammoths trumpeted in the gloom, 
strange voices called out in stranger tongues, and Septon Cellador prayed so loudly and drunkenly for 
the dawn to come that Jon was tempted to chuck him over the edge himself."
"They heard a mammoth 
dying at their feet and saw another lurch burning through the woods, trampling down men and trees alike."
The wind blew cold and colder.
"Hobb rode up the chain with cups of onion broth, and Owen and Clydas 
served them to the archers where they stood, so they could gulp them down between arrows."
"Zei took a 
place among them with her crossbow."
"Hours of repeated jars and shocks knocked something loose on 
the right-hand trebuchet, and its counterweight came crashing free, suddenly and catastrophically, 
wrenching the throwing arm sideways with a splintering crash."
"The left-hand trebuchet kept throwing, but 
the wildlings had quickly learned to shun the place where its loads were landing."
"We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so 
we could move them."
It was a futile thought.
"He might as well wish for another thousand men, and maybe 
a dragon or three."
"Donal Noye did not return, nor any of them who'd gone down with 
him to hold that black cold tunnel."
"The Wall is mine, Jon reminded himself whenever he felt his strength 
flagging."
"He had taken up a longbow himself, and his fingers felt crabbed and stiff, half-frozen."
"His fever 
was back as well, and his leg would tremble uncontrollably, sending a white-hot knife of pain right 
through him."
"One more arrow, and I'll rest, he told himself, half a hundred times."
Just one more.
"Whenever his quiver was empty, one of the orphaned moles would bring him another."
"One more quiver, 
and I'm done."
It couldn't be long until the dawn.
"When morning came, none of them quite realized it at first."
"The world was still dark, but the black had 
turned to grey and shapes were beginning to emerge half -seen from the gloom."
"Jon lowered his bow to 
stare at the mass of heavy clouds that covered the eastern sky."
"He could see a glow behind them, but 
perhaps he was only dreaming."
He notched another arrow.
Then the rising sun broke through to send pale lances of light across the battleground.
"Jon found himself 
holding his breath as he looked out over the half-mile swath of cleared land that lay between the Wall and 
the edge of the forest."
"In half a night they had turned it into a wasteland of blackened grass, bubbling 
pitch, shattered stone, and corpses."
The carcass of the burned mammoth was already drawing crows.
"There were giants dead on the ground as well, but behind them ..."
"Someone moaned to his left, and he heard Septon Cellador say, ""Mother have mercy, oh."
"Oh, oh, oh, 
Mother have mercy."""
"Beneath the trees were all the wildlings in the world; raiders and giants, wargs and skinchangers, 
mountain men, salt sea sailors, ice river cannibals, cave dwellers with dyed faces, dog chariots from the 
Frozen Shore, Hornfoot men with their soles like boiled leather, all the queer wild folk Mance had 
gathered to break the Wall."
"This is not your land, Jon wanted to shout at them."
"There is no place for you 
Page 570

here, Go away."
He could hear Tormund Giantsbane laughing at that.
"""You know nothing, Jon Snow,"" 
Ygritte would have said."
"He flexed his sword hand, opening and closing the fingers, though he knew full 
well that swords would not come into it up here."
"He was chilled and feverish, and suddenly the weight of the longbow was too much."
"The battle with the 
Magnar had been nothing, he realized, and the night fight less than nothing, only a probe, a dagger in the 
dark to try and catch them unprepared."
The real battle was only now beginning.
"""I never knew there would be so many,"" Satin said."
Jon had.
"He had seen them before, but not like this, not drawn up in battle array."
"On the march the 
wildling column had sprawled over long leagues like some enormous worm, but you never saw all of it at 
once."
"But now ... 
""Here they come,"" someone said in a hoarse voice."
"Mammoths centered the wildling line, he saw, a hundred or more with giants on their backs clutching 
mauls and huge stone axes."
"More giants loped beside them, pushing along a tree trunk on great wooden 
wheels, its end sharpened to a point."
"A ram, he thought bleakly."
"If the gate still stood below, a few kisses 
from that thing would soon turn it into splinters."
"On either side of the giants came a wave of horsemen in 
boiled leather harness with fire-hardened lances, a mass of running archers, hundreds of foot with spears, 
slings, clubs, and leathern shields."
"The bone chariots from the Frozen Shore clattered forward on the 
flanks, bouncing over rocks and roots behind teams of huge white dogs."
"The fury of the wild, Jon thought 
as he listened to the skirl of skins, to the dogs barking and baying, the mammoths trumpeting, the free 
folk whistling and screaming, the giants roaring in the Old Tongue."
"Their drums echoed off the ice like 
rolling thunder."
He could feel the despair all around him.
"""There must be a hundred thousand,"" Satin wailed."
"""How can 
we stop so many?"""
"""The Wall will stop them,"" Jon heard himself say."
"He turned and said it again, louder."
"""The Wall will stop 
them."
"The Wall defends itself."""
"Hollow words, but he needed to say them, almost as much as his brothers 
needed to hear them."
"""Mance wants to unman us with his numbers."
"Does he think we're stupid?"""
"He was 
shouting now, his leg forgotten, and every man was listening."
"""The chariots, the horsemen, all those fools 
on foot ... what are they going to do to us up here?"
"Any of you ever see a mammoth climb a wall?"""
"He 
laughed, and Pyp and Owen and half a dozen more laughed with him."
"""They're nothing, they're less use 
than our straw brothers here, they can't reach us, they can't hurt us, and they don't frighten us, do they?"""
"""NO"" Grenn shouted."
"""They're down there and we're up here,"" Jon said, ""and so long as we hold the gate they cannot pass."
"They cannot pass!"""
"They were all shouting then, roaring his own words back at him, waving swords and 
longbows in the air as their cheeks flushed red."
"Jon saw Kegs standing there with a warhorn slung 
beneath his arm."
"""Brother,"" he told him, ""sound for battle. """
"Grinning, Kegs lifted the horn to his lips, and blew the two long blasts that meant wildlings."
"Other horns 
took up the call until the Wall itself seemed to shudder, and the echo of those great deep-throated moans 
drowned all other sound."
"""Archers,"" Jon said when the horns had died away, ""you'll aim for the giants with that ram, every bloody 
one of you."
"Loose at my command, not before."
THE GIANTS AND THE RAM.
"I want arrows raining 
Page 571

on them with every step, but we'll wait till they're in range."
"Any man who wastes an arrow will need to 
climb down and fetch it back, do you hear me?"""
"""I do,"" shouted Owen the Oaf."
"""I hear you, Lord Snow."""
"Jon laughed, laughed like a drunk or a madman, and his men laughed with him."
"The chariots and the 
racing horsemen on the flanks were well ahead of the center now, he saw."
"The wildlings had not crossed 
a third of the half mile, yet their battle line was dissolving."
"""Load the trebuchet with caltrops,"" Jon said."
"""Owen, Kegs, angle the catapults toward the center."
"Scorpions, load with fire spears and loose at my 
command."""
He pointed at the Mole's Town boys.
"""You, you, and you, stand by with torches."""
"The wildling archers shot as they advanced; they would dash forward, stop, loose, then run another ten 
yards."
"There were so many that the air was constantly full of arrows, all falling woefully short."
"A waste, 
Jon thought."
Their want of discipline is showing.
"The smaller horn-and-wood bows of the free folk were 
outranged by the great yew longbows of the Night's Watch, and the wildlings were trying to shoot at men 
seven hundred feet above them."
"""Let them shoot,"" Jon said."
"""Wait."
"Hold."""
"Their cloaks were flapping 
behind them."
"""The wind is in our faces, it will cost us range."
"Wait."""
"Closer, closer."
"The skins wailed, the 
drums thundered, the wildling arrows fluttered and fell."
"""DRAW."""
Jon lifted his own bow and pulled the arrow to his ear.
"Satin did the same, and Grenn, Owen 
the Oaf, Spare Boot, Black Jack Bulwer, Arron and Emrick."
Zei hoisted her crossbow to her shoulder.
"Jon was watching the ram come on and on, the mammoths and giants lumbering forward on either side."
"They were so small he could have crushed them all in one hand, it seemed."
"If only my hand was big 
enough."
Through the killing ground they came.
"A hundred crows rose from the carcass of the dead 
mammoth as the wildlings thundered past to either side of them."
"Closer and closer, until ... 
""LOOSE"" 
The black arrows hissed downward, like snakes on feathered wings."
"Jon did not wait to see where they 
struck."
He reached for a second arrow as soon as the first left his bow.
"""NOTCH."
DRAW.
"LOOSE."""
As soon as the arrow flew he found another.
"""NOTCH."
"DRAW LOOSE."""
"Again, and then again."
"Jon 
shouted for the trebuchet, and heard the creak and heavy thud as a hundred spiked steel caltrops went 
spinning through the air."
"""Catapults,"" he called, ""scorpions."
"Bowmen, loose at will."""
"Wildling arrows were 
striking the Wall now, a hundred feet below them."
A second giant spun and staggered.
"Notch, draw, 
loose."
"A mammoth veered into another beside it, spilling giants on the ground."
"Notch, draw, loose."
"The 
ram was down and done, he saw, the giants who'd pushed it dead or dying."
"""Fire arrows,"" he shouted."
"""I 
want that ram burning."""
"The screams of wounded mammoths and the booming cries of giants mingled 
with the drums and pipes to make an awful music, yet still his archers drew and loosed, as if they'd all 
gone as deaf as dead Dick Follard."
"They might 
be the dregs of the order, but they were men of the Night's Watch, or near enough as made no matter."
That's why they shall not pass.
"One of the mammoths was running berserk, smashing wildlings with his trunk and crushing archers 
underfoot."
"Jon pulled back his bow once more, and launched another arrow at the beast's shaggy back 
to urge him on."
"To east and west, the flanks of the wildling host had reached the Wall unopposed."
"The 
chariots drew in or turned while the horsemen milled aimlessly beneath the looming cliff of ice."
"""At the 
gate!"""
a shout came.
"Spare Boot, maybe."
"""Mammoth at the gate!"""
"""Fire,"" Jon barked."
"""Grenn, Pyp."""
"Page 572

Grenn thrust his bow aside, wrestled a barrel of oil onto its side, and rolled it to the edge of the Wall, 
where Pyp hammered out the plug that sealed it, stuffed in a twist of cloth, and set it alight with a torch."
They shoved it over together.
"A hundred feet below it struck the Wall and burst, filling the air with 
shattered staves and burning oil."
"Grenn was rolling a second barrel to the precipice by then, and Kegs 
had one as well."
Pyp lit them both.
"""Got him!"""
"Satin shouted, his head sticking out so far that Jon was 
certain he was about to fall."
"""Got him, got him, GOT him!"""
He could hear the roar of fire.
"A flaming giant 
lurched into view, stumbling and rolling on the ground."
"Then suddenly the mammoths were fleeing, running from the smoke and flames and smashing into those 
behind them in their terror."
"Those went backward too, the giants and wildlings behind them scrambling to 
get out of their way."
In half a heartbeat the whole center was collapsing.
"The horsemen on the flanks saw 
themselves being abandoned and decided to fall back as well, not one so much as blooded."
"Even the 
chariots rumbled off, having done nothing but look fearsome and make a lot of noise."
"When they break, 
they break hard, Jon Snow thought as he watched them reel away."
The drums had all gone silent.
"How 
do you like that music, Mance?"
How do you like the taste of the Dornishman's wife?
"""Do we have 
anyone hurt?"""
he asked.
"""The bloody buggers got my leg."""
Spare Boot plucked the arrow out and waved it above his head.
"""The 
wooden one!"""
A ragged cheer went up.
"Zei grabbed Owen by the hands, spun him around in a circle, and gave him a 
long wet kiss right there for all to see."
"She tried to kiss Jon too, but he held her by the shoulder and 
pushed her gently but firmly away."
"""No,"" he said."
I am done with kissing.
"Suddenly he was too weary to 
stand, and his leg was agony from knee to groin."
He fumbled for his crutch.
"""Pyp, help me to the cage."
"Grenn, you have the Wall."""
"""Me?"""
said Grenn.
"""Him?"""
said Pyp.
It was hard to tell which of them was more horrified.
"""But,"" Grenn 
stammered, ""b-but what do I do if the wildlings attack again?"""
"""Stop them,"" Jon told him."
"As they rode down in the cage, Pyp took off his helm and wiped his brow."
"""Frozen sweat."
"Is there 
anything as disgusting as frozen sweat?"""
He laughed.
"""Gods, I don't think I have ever been so hungry."
"I 
could eat an aurochs whole, I swear it."
"Do you think Hobb will cook up Grenn for us?"""
"When he saw 
Jon's face, his smile died."
"""What's wrong?"
"Is it your leg?"""
"""My leg,"" Jon agreed."
Even the words were an effort.
"""Not the battle, though?"
"We won the battle."""
"""Ask me when I've seen the gate,"" Jon said grimly."
"I want a fire, a hot meal, a warm bed, and something 
to make my leg stop hurting, he told himself."
"But first he had to check the tunnel and find what had 
become of Donal Noye."
"After the battle with the Therms it had taken them almost a day to clear the ice and broken beams away 
from the inner gate."
"Spotted Pate and Kegs and some of the other builders had argued heatedly that they 
ought just leave the debris there, another obstacle for Mance."
"That would have meant abandoning the 
defense of the tunnel, though, and Noye was having none of it."
"With men in the murder holes and archers 
and spears behind each inner grate, a few determined brothers could hold off a hundred times as many 
wildlings and clog the way with corpses."
"He did not mean to give Mance Rayder free passage through 
the ice."
"So with pick and spade and ropes, they had moved the broken steps aside and dug back down 
Page 573

to the gate."
Jon waited by the cold iron bars while Pyp went to Maester Aemon for the spare key.
"Surprisingly, the 
maester himself returned with him, and Clydas with a lantern."
"""Come see me when we are done,"" the old 
man told Jon while Pyp was fumbling with the chains."
"""I need to change your dressing and apply a fresh 
poultice, and you will want some more drearnwine for the pain."""
Jon nodded weakly.
The door swung open.
"Pyp led them in, followed by Clydas and the lantern."
"It was 
all Jon could do to keep up with Maester Aemon."
"The ice pressed close around them, and he could feel 
the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall above his head."
"it felt like walking down the gullet 
of an ice dragon."
"The tunnel took a twist, and then another."
Pyp unlocked a second iron gate.
"They 
walked farther, turned again, and saw light ahead, faint and pale through the ice."
"That's bad, Jon knew at 
once."
That's very bad.
"Then Pyp said, ""There's blood on the floor."""
The last twenty feet of the tunnel was where they'd fought and died.
"The outer door of studded oak had 
been hacked and broken and finally torn off its hinges, and one of the giants had crawled in through the 
splinters."
The lantern bathed the grisly scene in a sullen reddish light.
"Pyp turned aside to retch, and Jon 
found himself envying Maester Aemon his blindness."
"Noye and his men had been waiting within, behind a gate of heavy iron bars like the two Pyp had just 
unlocked."
The two crossbows had gotten off a dozen quarrels as the giant struggled toward them.
"Then 
the spearmen must have come to the fore, stabbing through the bars."
"Still the giant found the strength to 
reach through, twist the head off Spotted Pate, seize the iron gate, and wrench the bars apart."
"Links of 
broken chain lay strewn across the floor."
One giant.
All this was the work of one giant.
"""Are they all dead?"""
Maester Aemon asked softly.
"""Yes."
"Donal was the last."""
"Noye's sword was sunk deep in the giant's throat, halfway to the hilt."
"The 
armorer had always seemed such a big man to Jon, but locked in the giant's massive arms he looked 
almost like a child."
"""The giant crushed his spine."
"I don't know who died first."""
"He took the lantern and 
moved forward for a better look."
"""Mag."""
I am the last of the giants.
"He could feel the sadness there, but 
he had no time for sadness."
"""It was Mag the Mighty."
"The king of the giants."""
He needed sun then.
"It was too cold and dark inside the tunnel, and the stench of blood and death was 
suffocating."
"Jon gave the lantern back to Clydas, squeezed around the bodies and through the twisted 
bars, and walked toward the daylight to see what lay beyond the splintered door."
The huge carcass of a dead mammoth partially blocked the way.
"One of the beast's tusks snagged his 
cloak and tore it as he edged past."
"Three more giants lay outside, half buried beneath stone and slush and 
hardened pitch."
"He could see where the fire had melted the Wall, where great sheets of ice had come 
sloughing off in the heat to shatter on the blackened ground."
He looked up at where they'd come from.
"When you stand here it seems immense, as if it were about to crush you."
Jon went back inside to where the others waited.
"""We need to repair the outer gate as best we can and 
then block up this section of the tunnel."
"Rubble, chunks of ice, anything."
"All the way to the second gate, if 
we can."
"Ser Wynton will need to take command, he's the last knight left, but he needs to move now, the 
giants will be back before we know it."
"We have to tell him - "" 
""Tell him what you will,"" said Maester Aemon, gently."
"""He will smile, nod, and forget."
"Thirty years ago 
Page 574

Ser Wynton Stout came within a dozen votes of being Lord Commander."
"He would have made a fine 
one."
Ten years ago he would still have been capable.
No longer.
"You know that as well as Donal did, 
Jon."""
It was true.
"""You give the order, then,"" Jon told the maester."
"""You have been on the Wall your whole 
life, the men will follow you."
"We have to close the gate."""
"""I am a maester chained and sworn."
"My order serves, Jon."
"We give counsel, not commands."""
"""Someone must - "" 
""You."
"You must lead."""
"""No."""
"""Yes, Jon."
It need not be for long.
"Only until such time as the garrison 
returns."
"Donal chose you, and Qhorin Halfhand before him."
"Lord Commander Mormont made you his 
steward."
"You are a son of Winterfell, a nephew of Benjen Stark."
It must be you or no one.
"The Wall is 
yours, Jon Snow."""
"Chapter 65 
ARYA 
She could feel the hole inside her every morning when she woke."
"It wasn't hunger, though sometimes 
there was that too."
"It was a hollow place, an emptiness where her heart had been, where her brothers 
had lived, and her parents."
Her head hurt too.
"Not as bad as it had at first, but still pretty bad."
"Arya was 
used to that, though, and at least the lump was going down."
But the hole inside her stayed the same.
"The 
hole will never feel any better, she told herself when she went to sleep."
Some mornings Arya did not want to wake at all.
"She would huddle beneath her cloak with her eyes 
squeezed shut and try to will herself back to sleep."
"If the Hound would only have left her alone, she 
would have slept all day and all night."
And dreamed.
"That was the best part, the dreaming."
She dreamed of wolves most every night.
"A great 
pack of wolves, with her at the head."
"She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster."
"She 
could outrun horses and outfight lions."
"When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly 
was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold."
"And her 
brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers."
"They would 
never leave her."
"But if her nights were full of wolves, her days belonged to the dog."
"Sandor Clegane made her get up 
every morning, whether she wanted to or not."
"He would curse at her in his raspy voice, or yank her to 
her feet and shake her."
Once he dumped a helm full of cold water all over her head.
"She bounced up 
sputtering and shivering and tried to kick him, but 
he only laughed."
"""Dry off and feed the bloody horses,"" he told her, and she did."
"They had two now, Stranger and a sorrel palfrey mare Arya had named Craven, because Sandor said 
she'd likely run off from the Twins the same as them."
"They'd found her wandering riderless through a field 
the morning after the slaughter."
"She was a good enough horse, but Arya could not love a coward."
"Page 575

Stranger would have fought."
"Still, she tended the mare as best she knew."
"It was better than riding double 
with the Hound."
"And Craven might have been a coward, but she was young and strong as well."
"Arya 
thought that she might be able to outrun Stranger, if it came to it."
The Hound no longer watched her as closely as he had.
"Sometimes he did not seem to care whether she 
stayed or went, and he no longer bound her up in a cloak at night."
"One night I'll kill him in his sleep, she 
told herself, but she never did."
"One day I'll ride away on Craven, and he won't be able to catch me, she 
thought, but she never did that either."
Where would she go?
Winterfell was gone.
"Her grandfather's 
brother was at Riverrun, but he didn't know her, no more than she knew him."
"Maybe Lady Smallwood 
would take her in at Acorn Hall, but maybe she wouldn't."
"Besides, Arya wasn't even sure she could find 
Acorn Hall again."
"Sometimes she thought she might go back to Shama's inn, if the floods hadn't washed it 
away."
"She could stay with Hot Pie, or maybe Lord Beric would find her there."
"Anguy would teach her to 
use a bow, and she could ride with Gendry and be an outlaw, like Wenda the White Fawn in the songs."
"But that was just stupid, like something Sansa might dream."
"Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon 
as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound."
"None of 
them wanted her around."
"They were never my pack, not even Hot Pie and Gendry."
"I was stupid to think 
so, just a stupid little girl, and no wolf a t all."
So she stayed with the Hound.
"They rode every day, never sleeping twice in the same place, avoiding 
towns and villages and castles as best they could."
"Once she asked Sandor Clegane where they were 
going."
"""Away,"" he said."
"""That's all you need to know."
"You're not worth spit to me now, and I don't want 
to hear your whining."
"I should have let you run into that bloody castle."""
"""You should have,"" she agreed, thinking of her mother."
"""You'd be dead if I had."
You ought to thank me.
"You ought to sing me a pretty little song, the way your 
sister did."""
"""Did you hit her with an axe too?"""
"""I hit you with the flat of the axe, you stupid little bitch."
"If I'd hit you with the blade there'd still be chunks 
of your head floating down the Green Fork."
Now shut your bloody mouth.
"If I had any sense I'd give you 
to the silent sisters."
"They cut the tongues out of girls who talk too much."""
That wasn't fair of him to say.
"Aside from that one time, Arya hardly talked at all."
"Whole days passed when neither of them said 
anything."
"She was too empty to talk, and the Hound was too angry."
"She could feel the fury in him; she 
could see it on his face, the way his mouth would tighten and twist, the looks he gave her."
"Whenever he 
took his axe to chop some wood for a fire, he would slide into a cold rage, hacking savagely at the tree 
or the deadfall or the broken limb, until they had twenty times as much kindling and firewood as they'd 
needed."
"Sometimes he would be so sore and tired afterward that he would lie down and go right to sleep 
without even lighting a fire."
"Arya hated it when that happened, and hated him too."
"Those were the nights 
when she stared the longest at the axe."
"It looks awfully heavy, but I bet I could swing it."
"She wouldn't hit 
him with the flat, either."
"Sometimes in their wanderings they glimpsed other people; farmers in their fields, swineherds with their 
pigs, a milkmaid leading a cow, a squire carrying a message down a rutted road."
"She never wanted to 
speak to them either."
"it was as if they lived in some distant land and spoke a queer alien tongue; they had 
nothing to do with her, or her with them."
"Besides, it wasn't safe to be seen."
"From time to time columns of horsemen passed down the winding 
Page 576

farm roads, the twin towers of Frey flying before them."
"""Hunting for stray northmen,"" the Hound said 
when they had passed."
"""Any time you hear hooves, get your head down fast, it's not like to be a friend."""
"one day, in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen oak, they came face to face with another 
survivor of the Twins."
"The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk, and he 
told them he was Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman, though he'd lost his bow."
"His left shoulder was all 
twisted and swollen where it met his arm; a blow from a mace, he said, it had broken his shoulder and 
smashed his chainmail deep into his flesh."
"""A northman, it was,"" he wept."
"""His badge was a bloody man, 
and he saw mine and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe they should get together."
"I drank to 
his Lord Bolton, he drank to Ser Marq, and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the 
King in the North."
"And then he killed me."""
"His eyes were fever bright when he said that, and Arya could 
tell that it was true."
"His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left 
side."
There was a stink to him too.
He smells like a corpse.
The man begged them for a drink of wine.
"""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him."
"""I can give you water, and the gift of 
mercy."""
"The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog. """
"""My own dog now."
"Do you want the water?"""
"""Aye."""
The man swallowed.
"""And the mercy."
"Please."""
They had passed a small pond a short ways back.
"Sandor gave Arya his helm and told her to fill it, so 
she trudged back to the water's edge."
Mud squished over the toe of her boots.
"She used the dog's head 
as a pail."
"Water ran out through the eyeholes, but the bottom of the helm still held a lot."
"When she came back, the archer turned his face up and she poured the water into his mouth."
"He gulped 
it down as fast as she could pour, and what he couldn't gulp ran down his cheeks into the brown blood 
that crusted his whiskers, until pale pink tears dangled from his beard."
"When the water was gone he 
clutched the helm and licked the steel."
"""Good,"" he said."
"""I wish it was wine, though."
"I wanted wine."""
"""Me too."""
"The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body 
driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath."
"As he slid the blade back out and 
wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya."
"""That's where the heart is, girl."
"That's how you kill a man."""
That's one way.
"""Will we bury him?"""
"""Why?"""
Sandor said.
"""He don't care, and we've got no spade."
Leave him for the wolves and wild dogs.
"Your brothers and mine."""
He gave her a hard look.
"""First we rob him, though."""
"There were two silver stags in the archer's purse, and almost thirty coppers."
"His dagger had a pretty 
pink stone in the hilt."
"The Hound hefted the knife in his hand, then flipped it toward Arya."
"She caught it 
by the hilt, slid it through her belt, and felt a little better."
"It wasn't Needle, but it was steel."
"The dead man 
had a quiver of arrows too, but arrows weren't much good without a bow."
"His boots were too big for 
Arya and too small for the Hound, so those they left."
"She took his kettle helm as well, even though it 
came down almost past her nose, so she had to tilt it back to see."
"""He must have had a horse as well, or 
he wouldn't have got away,"" Clegane said, peering about, ""but it's bloody well gone, I'd say."
"No telling 
how long he's been here."""
"By the time they found themselves in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon, the rains had mostly 
Page 577

stopped."
"Arya could see the sun and moon and stars, and it seemed to her that they were heading 
eastward."
"""Where are we going?"""
she asked again.
This time the Hound answered her.
"""You have an aunt in the Eyrie."
"Might be she'll want to ransom your 
scrawny arse, though the gods know why."
"Once we find the high road, we can follow it all the way to the 
Bloody Gate."""
Aunt Lysa.
The thought left Arya feeling empty.
"It was her mother she wanted, not her mother's sister."
"She didn't know her mother's sister 
any more than she knew her great uncle Blackfish."
We should have gone into the castle.
"They didn't 
really know that her mother was dead, or Robb either."
it wasn't like they'd seen them die or anything.
Maybe Lord Frey had just taken them captive.
"Maybe they were chained up in his dungeon, or maybe 
the Freys were taking them to King's Landing so Joffrey could chop their heads off."
They didn't know.
"""We should go back,"" she suddenly decided."
"""We should go back to the Twins and get my mother."
"She 
can't be dead."
"We have to help her."""
"""I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,"" the Hound growled."
"""Frey might have kept 
your mother alive to ransom, that's true."
"But there's no way in seven hells I'm going to pluck her out of his 
castle all by my bloody self."""
"""Not by yourself."
"I'd come too."""
He made a sound that was almost a laugh.
"""That will scare the piss out of the old man."""
"""You're just afraid to die!"""
she said scornfully.
Now Clegane did laugh.
"""Death don't scare me."
Only fire.
"Now be quiet, or I'll cut your tongue out 
myself and save the silent sisters the bother."
"It's the Vale for us."""
"Arya didn't think he'd really cut her tongue out; he was just saying that the way Pinkeye used to say he'd 
beat her bloody."
"All the same, she wasn't going to try him."
Sandor Clegane was no Pinkeye.
"Pinkeye 
didn't cut people in half or hit them with axes."
Not even with the flat of axes.
"That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his 
sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself."
"When she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face against the 
back of her eyelids."
"She's so close I could almost smell her ... 
... and then she could smell her."
"The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath moss and mud 
and water, and the stench of rotting reeds and rotting men."
"She padded slowly through the soft ground to 
the river's edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted her head to sniff."
"The sky was grey and thick with cloud, the 
river green and full of floating things."
"Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water 
pushed them, others washed up on the banks."
"Her brothers and sisters swarmed around them, tearing at 
the rich ripe flesh."
"The crows were there too, screaming at the wolves and filling the air with feathers."
"Their blood was 
hotter, and one of her sisters had snapped at one as it took flight and caught it by the wing."
"It made her 
want a crow herself."
"She wanted to taste the blood, to hear the bones crunch between her teeth, to fill 
her belly with warm flesh instead of cold."
"She was hungry and the meat was all around, but she knew she 
could not eat."
"Page 578

The scent was stronger now."
"She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her pack, the 
shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water."
"Somewhere far off she could hear 
horses and the calls of living men, but they were not what mattered."
Only the scent mattered.
"She sniffed 
the air again."
"There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, 
turning where it brushed against a snag."
The reeds bowed down before it.
"She splashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water, her legs churning."
"The 
current was strong but she was stronger."
"She swam, following her nose."
"The river smells were rich and 
wet, but those were not the smells that pulled her."
"She paddled after the sharp red whisper of cold blood, 
the sweet cloying stench of death."
"She chased them as she had often chased a red deer through the trees, 
and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed around a pale white arm."
"She shook it to make it 
move, but there was only death and blood in her mouth."
"By now she was tiring, and it was all she could 
do to pull the body back to shore."
"As she dragged it up the muddy bank, one of her little brothers came 
prowling, his tongue lolling from his mouth."
"She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would have fed."
Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur.
"The white thing lay facedown in the mud, her 
dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat."
"Rise, she thought."
"Rise and eat and run 
with us."
The sound of horses turned her head.
Men.
"They were coming from downwind, so she had not smelled 
them, but now they were almost here."
"Men on horses, with flapping black and yellow and pink wings and 
long shiny claws in hand."
"Some of her younger brothers bared their teeth to defend the food they'd found, 
but she snapped at them until they scattered."
That was the way of the wild.
"Deer and hares and crows 
fled before wolves, and wolves fled from men."
"She abandoned the cold white prize in the mud where she 
had dragged it, and ran, and felt no shame."
"When morning came, the Hound did not need to shout at Arya or shake her awake."
"She had woken 
before him for a change, and even watered the horses."
"They broke their fast in silence, until Sandor said, 
""This thing about your mother..."" 
""It doesn't matter,"" Arya said in a dull voice."
"""I know she's dead."
"I saw her in a dream."""
"The Hound looked at her a long time, then nodded."
No more was said of it.
"They rode on toward the 
mountains."
"in the higher hills, they came upon a tiny isolated village surrounded by grey-green sentinels and tall blue 
soldier pines, and Clegane decided to risk going in."
"""We need food,"" he said, ""and a roof over our heads."
"They're not like to know what happened at the Twins, and with any luck they won't know me."""
"The villagers were building a wooden palisade around their homes, and when they saw the breadth of 
the Hound's shoulders they offered them food and shelter and even coin for work."
"""If there's wine as 
well, I'll do it,"" he growled at them."
"in the end, he settled for ale, and drank himself to sleep each night."
"His dream of selling Arya to Lady Arryn died there in the hills, though."
"""There's frost above us and snow 
in the high passes,"" the village elder said."
"""If you don't freeze or starve, the shadowcats will get you, or 
the cave bears."
There's the clans as well.
"The Burned Men are fearless since Timett One-Eye came back 
from the war."
"And half a year ago, Gunthor son of Gurn led the Stone Crows down on a village not eight 
miles from here."
"They took every woman and every scrap of grain, and killed half the men."
"They have 
steel now, good swords and mail hauberks, and they watch the high road - the Stone Crows, the Milk 
Snakes, the Sons of the Mist, all of them."
"Might be you'd take a few with you, but in the end they'd kill 
you and make off with your daughter."""
"Page 579

I'm not his daughter, Arya might have shouted, if she hadn't felt so tired."
"She was no one's daughter 
now."
She was no one.
"Not Arya, not Weasel, not Nan nor Arry nor Squab, not even Lumpyhead."
"She 
was only some girl who ran with a dog by day, and dreamed of wolves by night."
It was quiet in the village.
"They had beds stuffed with straw and not too many lice, the food was plain 
but filling, and the air smelled of pines."
"All the same, Arya soon decided that she hated it."
"The villagers 
were cowards."
"None of them would even look at the Hound's face, at least not for long."
"Some of the 
women tried to put her in a dress and make her do needlework, but they weren't Lady Smallwood and 
she was having none of it."
"And there was one girl who took to following her, the village elder's daughter."
"She was of an age with Arya, but just a child; she cried if she skinned a knee, and carried a stupid cloth 
doll with her everywhere she went."
"The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms, sort of, so the girl 
called him Ser Soldier and bragged how he kept her safe."
"""Go away,"" Arya told her half a hundred times."
"""Just leave me be."""
"She wouldn't, though, so finally Arya took the doll away from her, ripped it open, and 
pulled the rag stuffing out of its belly with a finger."
"""Now he really looks like a soldier!"""
"she said, before 
she threw the doll in a brook."
"After that the girl stopped pestering her, and Arya spent her days grooming 
Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods."
"Sometimes she would find a stick and practice her 
needlework, but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree 
until it broke."
"""Might be we should stay here awhile,"" the Hound told her, after a fortnight."
"He was drunk on ale, but 
more brooding than sleepy."
"""We'd never reach the Eyrie, and the Freys will still be hunting survivors in 
the riverlands."
"Sounds like they need swords here, with these clansmen raiding."
"We can rest up, maybe 
find a way to get a letter to your aunt."""
Arya's face darkened when she heard that.
"She didn't want to 
stay, but there was nowhere to go, either."
"The next morning, when the Hound went off to chop down 
trees and haul logs, she crawled back into bed."
"But when the work was done and the tall wooden palisade was finished, the village elder made it plain 
that there was no place for them."
"""Come winter, we will be hard pressed to feed our own,"" he explained."
"""And you ... a man like you brings blood with him."""
Sandor's mouth tightened.
"""So you do know who I am."""
"""Aye."
"We don't get travelers here, that's so, but we go to market, and to fairs."
"We know about King 
Joffrey's dog."""
"""When these Stone Crows come calling, you might be glad to have a dog."""
"""Might be."""
"The man hesitated, then gathered up his courage."
"""But they say you lost your belly for 
fighting at the Blackwater."
"They say - "" 
""I know what they say."""
Sandor's voice sounded like two woodsaws grinding together.
"""Pay me, and 
we'll be gone."""
"When they left, the Hound had a pouch full of coppers, a skin of sour ale, and a new sword."
"It was a 
very old sword, if truth be told, though new to him."
"He swapped its owner the longaxe he'd taken at the 
Twins, the one he'd used to raise the lump on Arya's head."
"The ale was gone in less than a day, but 
Clegane sharpened the sword every night, cursing the man he'd swapped with for every nick and spot of 
rust."
"If he lost his belly for fighting, why does he care if his sword is sharp?"
"It was not a question Arya 
dared ask him, but she thought on it a lot."
Was that why he'd run from the Twins and carried her off?
"Page 580

Back in the riverlands, they found that the rains had ebbed away, and the flood waters had begun to 
recede."
"The Hound turned south, back toward the Trident."
"""We'll make for Riverrun,"" he told Arya as 
they roasted a hare he'd killed."
"""Maybe the Blackfish wants to buy himself a she-wolf."""
"""He doesn't know me."
"He won't even know I'm really me."""
Arya was tired of making for Riverrun.
"She 
had been making for Riverrun for years, it seemed, without ever getting there."
"Every time she made for 
Riverrun, she ended up someplace worse."
"""He won't give you any ransom."
"He'll probably just hang you."""
"""He's free to try."""
He turned the spit.
He doesn't talk like he's lost his belly for fighting.
"""I know where we could go,"" Arya said."
"She still had 
one brother left."
"fon will want me, even if no one else does."
"He'll call me ""little sister"" and muss my hair."
"It 
was a long way, though, and she didn't think she could get there by herself."
"She hadn't even been able to 
reach Riverrun."
"""We could go to the Wall."""
Sandor's laugh was half a growl.
"""The little wolf bitch wants to join the Night's Watch, does she?"""
"""My brother's on the Wall,"" she said stubbornly."
His mouth gave a twitch.
"""The Wall's a thousand leagues from here."
"We'd need to fight through the 
bloody Freys just to reach the Neck."
"There's lizard lions in those swamps that eat wolves every day for 
breakfast."
"And if we did reach the north with our skins intact, there's ironborn in half the castles, and 
thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well."""
"""Are you scared of them?"""
she asked.
"""Have you lost your belly for fighting?"""
For a moment she thought he was going to hit her.
"By then the hare was brown, though, skin crackling 
and grease popping as it dripped down into the cookfire."
"Sandor took it off the stick, ripped it apart with 
his big hands, and tossed half of it into Arya's lap."
"""There's nothing wrong with my belly,"" he said as he 
pulled off a leg, ""but I don't give a rat's arse for you or your brother."
"I have a brother too."""
"Chapter 66 
TYRION 
""Tyrion,"" Ser Kevan Lannister said wearily, ""if you are indeed innocent of Joffrey's death, you should 
have no difficulty 
proving it at trial."""
Tyrion turned from the window.
"""Who is to judge me?"""
""" justice belongs to the throne."
"The king is dead, but your father remains Hand."
"Since it is his own son 
who stands accused and his grandson who was the victim, he has asked Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn 
to sit in judgment with him."""
Tyrion was scarcely reassured.
"Mace Tyrell had been Joffrey's goodfather, however briefly, and the Red 
Page 581

Viper was ... well, a snake."
"""Will I be allowed to demand trial by battle?"""
"""I would not advise that."""
"""Why not?"""
"It had saved him in the Vale, why not here?"
"""Answer me, Uncle."
"Will I be allowed a trial by 
battle, and a champion to prove my innocence?"""
"""Certainly, if such is your wish."
"However, you had best know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor 
Clegane as her champion, in the event of such a trial."""
The bitch checks my moves before I make them.
A pity she didn't choose a Kettleblack.
"Bronn would 
make short work of any of the three brothers, but the Mountain That Rides was a kettle of a different 
color."
"""I shall need to sleep on this."""
"I need to speak with Bronn, and soon."
"He didn't want to think about 
what this was like to cost him."
Bronn had a lofty notion of what his skin was worth.
"""Does Cersei have 
witnesses against me?"""
"""More every day."""
"""Then I must have witnesses of my own."""
"""Tell me who you would have, and Ser Addarn will send the Watch to bring them to the trial."""
"""I would sooner find them myself."""
"""You stand accused of regicide and kinslaying."
"Do you truly imagine you will be allowed to come and go 
as you please?"""
Ser Kevan waved at the table.
"""You have quill, ink, and parchment."
"Write the names of 
such witnesses as you require, and I shall do all in my power to produce them, you have my word as a 
Lannister."
"But you shall not leave this tower, except to go to trial."""
Tyrion would not demean himself by begging.
"""Will you permit my squire to come and go?"
"The boy 
Podrick Payne?"""
"""Certainly, if that is your wish."
"I shall send him to you."""
"""Do so."
"Sooner would be better than later, and now would be better than sooner."""
"He waddled to the 
writing table."
"But when he heard the door open, he turned back and said, ""Uncle?"""
Ser Kevan paused.
"""Yes?"""
"""I did not do this."""
"""I wish I could believe that, Tyrion."""
"When the door closed, Tyrion Lannister pulled himself up into the chair, sharpened a quill, and pulled a 
blank parchment."
Who will speak for me?
He dipped his quill in the inkpot.
"The sheet was still maiden when Podrick Payne appeared, sometime later."
"""My lord,"" the boy said."
Tyrion put down the quill.
"""Find Bronn and bring him at once."
"Tell him there's gold in it, more gold than 
he's ever dreamt of, and see that you don't return without him."""
"Page 582

""Yes, my lord."
"I mean, no."
I won't.
"Return."""
He went.
"He had not returned by sunset, nor by moonrise."
"Tyrion fell asleep in the window seat to wake stiff and 
sore at dawn."
"A serving man brought porridge and apples to break his fast, with a horn of ale."
"He ate at 
the table, the blank parchment before him."
"An hour later, the serving man returned for the bowl."
"""Have 
you seen my squire?"""
Tyrion asked him.
The man shook his head.
"Sighing, he turned back to the table, and dipped the quill again."
"Sansa, he wrote upon the parchment."
"He 
sat staring at the name, his teeth clenched so hard they hurt."
"Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of food, which even Tyrion found hard to 
swallow, Sansa must have poisoned him."
"loff practically put his cup down in her lap, and he'd given her 
ample reason."
Any doubts Tyrion might have had vanished when his wife did.
"One flesh, one heart, one 
soul."
His mouth twisted.
"She wasted 
no time proving how much those vows meant to her, did she?"
"Well, what did you expect, dwarf?"
And yet ... where would Sansa have gotten poison?
He could not believe the girl had acted alone in this.
Do I really want to find her?
"Would the judges believe that Tyrion's child bride had poisoned a king 
without her husband's knowledge?"
I wouldn't.
Cersei would insist that they had done the deed together.
"Even so, he gave the parchment to his uncle the next day."
Ser Kevan frowned at it.
"""Lady Sansa is your 
only witness?"""
"""I will think of others in time."""
"""Best think of them now."
"The judges mean to begin the trial three days hence."""
"""That's too soon."
"You have me shut up here under guard, how am I to find witnesses to my innocence?"""
"""Your sister's had no difficulty finding witnesses to your guilt."""
Ser Kevan rolled up the parchment.
"""Ser 
Addam has men hunting for your wife."
"Varys has offered a hundred stags for word of her whereabouts, 
and a hundred dragons for the girl herself."
"If the girl can be found she will be found, and I shall bring her 
to you."
"I see no harm in husband and wife sharing the same cell and giving comfort to one another."""
"""You are too kind."
"Have you seen my squire?"""
"""I sent him to you yesterday."
"Did he not come?"""
"""He came,"" Tyrion admitted, ""and then he went."""
"""I shall send him to you again."""
But it was the next morning before Podrick Payne returned.
"He stepped inside the room hesitantly, with 
fear written all over his face."
Bronn came in behind him.
"The sellsword knight wore a jerkin studded with 
silver and a heavy riding cloak, with a pair of fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through his swordbelt."
One look at Bronn's face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach.
"""It took you long 
enough."""
"""The boy begged, or I wouldn't have come at all."
"I am expected at Castle Stokeworth for supper."""
"Page 583

""Stokeworth?"""
Tyrion hopped from the bed.
"""And pray, what is there for you in Stokeworth?"""
"""A bride."""
Brorm smiled like a wolf contemplating a lost lamb.
"""I'm to wed Lollys the day after next."""
"""Lollys."""
"Perfect, bloody perfect."
"Lady Tanda's lackwit daughter gets a knightly husband and a father of 
sorts for the bastard in her belly, and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater climbs another rung."
"It had Cersei's 
stinking fingers all over it."
"""My bitch sister has sold you a lame horse."
"The girl's dim-witted."""
"""If I wanted wits, Id marry you."""
"""Lollys is big with another man's child."""
"""And when she pops him out, I'll get her big with mine."""
"""She's not even heir to Stokeworth,"" Tyrion pointed out."
"""She has an elder sister."
Falyse.
"A married 
sister."""
"""Married ten years, and still barren,"" said Bronn."
"""Her lord husband shuns her bed."
"It's said he prefers 
virgins."""
"""He could prefer goats and it wouldn't matter."
"The lands will still pass to his wife when Lady Tanda 
dies."""
"""Unless Falyse should die before her mother."""
"Tyrion wondered whether Cersei had any notion of the sort of serpent she'd given Lady Tanda to 
suckle."
"And if she does, would she care?"
"""Why are you here, then?"""
Bronn shrugged.
"""You once told me that if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double the 
price."""
Yes.
"""Is it two wives you want, or two castles?"""
"""One of each would serve."
"But if you want me to kill Gregor Clegane for you, it had best be a damned 
big castle."""
"The Seven Kingdoms were full of highborn maidens, but even the oldest, poorest, and ugliest spinster in 
the realm would balk at wedding such lowborn scum as Bronn."
"Unless she was soft of body and soft of 
head, with a fatherless child in her belly from having been raped half a hundred times."
"Lady Tanda had 
been so desperate to find a husband for Lollys that she had even pursued Tyrion for a time, and that had 
been before half of King's Landing enjoyed her."
"No doubt Cersei had sweetened the offer somehow, 
and Brorm was a knight now, which made him a suitable match for a younger daughter of a minor house."
"""I find myself woefully short of both castles and highborn maidens at the moment,"" Tyrion admitted."
"""But 
I can offer you gold and gratitude, as before."""
"""I have gold."
"What can I buy with gratitude?"""
"""You might be surprised."
"A Lannister pays his debts."""
"Page 584

""Your sister is a Lannister too."""
"""My lady wife is heir to Winterfell."
"Should I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may 
one day rule the north in her name."
"I could carve you out a big piece of it."""
"""If and when and might be,"" said Bronn."
"""And it's bloody cold up there."
"Lollys is soft, warm, and close."
"I 
could be poking her two nights hence."""
"""Not a prospect I would relish."""
"""Is that so?"""
Bronn grinned.
"""Admit it, Imp."
"Given a choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the 
Mountain, you'd have your breeches down and cock up before a man could blink."""
He knows me too bloody well.
Tyrion tried a different tack.
"""I'd heard 
that Ser Gregor was wounded on the Red Fork, and again at Duskendale."
"The wounds are bound to 
slow him."""
Bronn looked annoyed.
"""He was never fast."
Only freakish big and freakish strong.
"I'll grant you, he's 
quicker than you'd expect for a man that size."
"He has a monstrous long reach, and doesn't seem to feel 
blows the way a normal man would."""
"""Does he frighten you so much? """
"asked Tyrion, hoping to provoke him."
"""if he didn't frighten me, I'd be a bloody fool."""
Bronn gave a shrug.
"""Might be I could take him."
"Dance 
around him until he was so tired of hacking at me that he couldn't lift his sword."
"Get him off his feet 
somehow."
When they're flat on their backs it don't matter how tall they are.
"Even so, it's chancy."
"One 
misstep and I'm dead."
Why should I risk it?
"I like you well enough, ugly little whoreson that you are ... 
but if I fight your battle, I lose either way."
"Either the Mountain spills my guts, or I kill him and lose 
Stokeworth."
"I sell my sword, I don't give it away."
"I'm not your bloody brother."""
"""No,"" said Tyrion sadly."
"""You're not."""
He waved a hand.
"""Begone, then."
"Run to Stokeworth and Lady 
Lollys."
"May you find more joy in your marriage bed than I ever found in mine."""
Bronn hesitated at the door.
"""What will you do, Imp?"""
"""Kill Gregor myself."
"Won't that make for a jolly song?"""
",'I hope I hear them sing it."""
"Bronn grinned one last time, and walked out of the door, the castle, and his 
life."
Pod shuffled his feet.
"""I'm sorry."""
"""Why?"
is it your fault that Bronn's an insolent black-hearted rogue?
"He's always been an insolent 
black-hearted rogue."
"That's what I liked about him."""
"Tyrion poured himself a cup of wine and took it to 
the window seat."
"Outside the day was grey and rainy, but the prospect was still more cheerful than his."
"He could send Podrick Payne questing after Shagga, he supposed, but there were so many hiding places 
in the deep of the kingswood that outlaws often evaded capture for decades."
"And Pod sometimes has 
difficulty finding the kitchens when I send him down for cheese."
"Timett son of Timett would likely be 
back in the Mountains of the Moon by now."
"And despite what he'd told Bronn, going up against Ser 
Gregor Clegane in his own person would be a bigger farce than Joffrey's jousting dwarfs."
"He did not 
Page 585

intend to die with gales of laughter ringing in his ears."
So much for trial by combat.
"Ser Kevan paid him another call later that day, and again the day after."
"Sansa had not been found, his 
uncle informed him politely."
"Nor the fool Ser Dontos, who'd vanished the same night."
"Did Tyrion have 
any more witnesses he wished to summon?"
He did not.
"How do I bloody well prove I didn't poison the 
wine, when a thousand people saw me fill /off 's cup?"
He did not sleep at all that night.
"Instead he lay in the dark, staring up at the canopy and counting his ghosts."
"He saw Tysha smiling as she 
kissed him, saw Sansa naked and shivering in fear."
"He saw Joffrey clawing his throat, the blood running 
down his neck as his face turned black."
"He saw Cersei's eyes, Bronn's wolfish smile, Shae's wicked grin."
Even thought of Shae could not arouse him.
"He fondled himself, thinking that perhaps if he woke his cock 
and satisfied it, he might rest more easily afterward, but it was no good."
"And then it was dawn, and time for his trial to begin."
"It was not Ser Kevan who came for him that morning, but Ser Addam Marbrand with a dozen gold 
cloaks."
"Tyrion had broken his fast on boiled eggs, burned bacon, and fried bread, and dressed in his 
finest."
"""Ser Addam,"" he said."
"""I had thought my father might send the Kingsguard to escort me to trial."
"I 
am still a member of the royal family, am I not?"""
"""You are, my lord, but I fear that most of the Kingsguard stand witness against you."
"Lord Tywin felt it 
would not be proper for them to serve as your guards."""
"""Gods forbid we do anything improper."
"Please, lead on."""
"He was to be tried in the throne room, where Joffrey had died."
"As Ser Addam marched him through the 
towering bronze doors and down the long carpet, he felt the eyes upon him."
"Hundreds had crowded in to 
see him judged."
At least he hoped that was why they had come.
"For all I know, they're all witnesses 
against me."
"He spied Queen Margaery up in the gallery, pale and beautiful in her mourning."
"Twice wed 
and twice widowed, and only sixteen."
"Her mother stood tall to one side of her, her grandmother small on 
the other, with her ladies in waiting and her father's household knights packing the rest of the gallery."
"The dais still stood beneath the empty iron Throne, though all but one table had been removed."
"Behind it 
sat stout Lord Mace Tyrell in a gold mantle over green, and slender Prince Oberyn Martell in flowing 
robes of striped orange, yellow, and scarlet."
Lord Tywin Lannister sat between them.
"Perhaps there's 
hope for me yet."
The Domishman and the Highgardener despised each other.
"If I can ftnd a way to use 
that ..."
"The High Septon began with a prayer, asking the Father Above to guide them to justice."
"When he was 
done the father below leaned forward to say, ""Tyrion, did you kill King Joffrey?"""
He would not waste a heartbeat.
"""No."""
"""Well, that's a relief,"" said Oberyn Martell dryly."
"""Did Sansa Stark do it, then?"""
Lord Tyrell demanded.
"I would have, if I'd been her."
"Yet wherever Sansa was and whatever her part in this might have been, 
she remained his wife."
"He had wrapped the cloak of his protection about her shoulders, though he'd had 
Page 586

to stand on a fool's back to do it."
"""The gods killed Joffrey."
"He choked on his pigeon pie."""
Lord Tyrell reddened.
"""You would blame the bakers?"""
"""Them, or the pigeons."
"just leave me out of it."""
"Tyrion heard nervous laughter, and knew he'd made a 
mistake."
"Guard your tongue, you little fool, before it digs your grave."
"""There are witnesses against you,"" Lord Tywin said."
"""We shall hear them first."
"Then you may present 
your own witnesses."
"You are to speak only with our leave."""
There was naught that Tyrion could do but nod.
Ser Addarn had told it true; the first man ushered in was Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard.
"""Lord 
Hand,"" he began, after the High Septon had sworn him to speak only truth, ""I had the honor to fight 
beside your son on the bridge of ships."
"He is a brave man for all his size, and I will not believe he did this 
thing."""
"A murmur went through the hall, and Tyrion wondered what mad game Cersei was playing."
"Why offer a 
witness that believes me innocent?"
He soon learned.
"Ser Balon spoke reluctantly of how he had pulled 
Tyrion away from Joffrey on the day of the riot."
"""He did strike His Grace, that's so."
"It was a fit of wroth, 
no more."
A summer storm.
"The mob near killed us all."""
"""In the days of the Targaryens, a man who struck one of the blood royal would lose the hand he struck 
him with,"" observed the Red Viper of Dome."
"""Did the dwarf regrow his little hand, or did you White 
Swords forget your duty?"""
"""He was of the blood royal himself,"" Ser Balon answered."
"""And the King's Hand beside."""
"""No,"" Lord Tywin said."
"""He was acting Hand, in my stead."""
"Ser Meryn Trant was pleased to expand on Ser Balon's account, when he took his place as witness."
"""He knocked the king to the ground and began kicking him."
"He shouted that it was unjust that His Grace 
had escaped unharmed from the mobs."""
Tyrion began to grasp his sister's plan.
"She began with a man known to be honest, and milked him for all 
he would give."
"Every witness to follow will tell a worse tale, until I seem as bad as Maegor the Cruel and 
Aerys the Mad together, with a pinch of Aegon the Unworthy for spice."
Ser Meryn went on to relate how Tyrion had stopped Joffrey's chastisement of Sansa Stark.
"""The dwarf 
asked His Grace if he knew what had happened to Aerys Targaryen."
"When Ser Boros spoke up in 
defense of the king, the Imp threatened to have him killed."""
"Blount himself came next, to echo that sorry tale."
"Whatever mislike Ser Boros might harbor toward 
Cersei for dismissing him from the Kingsguard, he said the words she wanted all the same."
Tyrion could no longer hold his tongue.
"""Tell the judges what Joffrey was doing, why don't you?"""
The big jowly man glared at him.
"""You told your savages to kill me if I opened my mouth, that's what I'll 
tell them."""
"""Tyrion,"" Lord Tywin said."
"""You are to speak only when we call upon you."
"Take this for a warning."""
"Page 587

Tyrion subsided, seething."
"The Kettleblacks came next, all three of them in turn."
"Osney and Osfryd told the tale of his supper with 
Cersei before the Battle of the Blackwater, and of the threats he'd made."
"""He told Her Grace that he meant to do her harm,"" said Ser Osfryd."
"""To hurt her."""
"His brother Osney 
elaborated."
"""He said he would wait for a day when she was happy, and make her joy turn to ashes in her 
mouth."""
Neither mentioned Alayaya.
"Ser Osmund Kettleblack, a vision of chivalry in immaculate scale armor and white wool cloak, swore 
that King Joffrey had long known that his uncle Tyrion meant to murder him."
"""It was the day they gave 
me the white cloak, my lords,"" he told the judges."
"""That brave boy said to me, 'Good Ser Osmund, guard 
me well, for my uncle loves me not."
"He means to be king in my place.""'"
That was more than Tyrion could stomach.
"""Liar!"""
"He took two steps forward before the gold cloaks 
dragged him back."
Lord Tywin frowned.
"""Must we have you chained hand and foot like a common brigand?"""
Tyrion gnashed his teeth.
"A second mistake, fool, fool, fool of a dwarf."
"Keep your calm or you're 
doomed."
"""No."
"I beg your pardons, my lords."
"His lies angered me."""
"""His truths, you mean,"" said Cersei."
"""Father, I beg you to put him in fetters, for your own protection."
"You see how he is."""
"""I see he's a dwarf,"" said Prince Oberyn."
"""The day I fear a dwarf's wrath is the day I drown myself in a 
cask of red."""
"""We need no fetters."""
"Lord Tywin glanced at the windows, and rose."
"""The hour grows late."
"We shall 
resume on the morrow."""
"That night, alone in his tower cell with a blank parchment and a cup of wine, Tyrion found himself 
thinking of his wife."
"Not Sansa; his first wife, Tysha."
"The whore wife, not the wolf wife."
"Her love for him 
had been pretense, and yet he had believed, and found joy in that belief."
"Give me sweet lies, and keep 
your bitter truths."
He drank his wine and thought of Shae.
"Later, when Ser Kevan paid his nightly visit, 
Tyrion asked for Varys."
"""You believe the eunuch will speak in your defense?"""
"""I won't know until I have talked with him."
"Send him here, Uncle, if you would be so good."""
"""As you wish."""
Maesters Ballabar and Frenken opened the second day of trial.
"They 
had opened King Joffrey's noble corpse as well, they swore, and found no morsel of pigeon pie nor any 
other food lodged in the royal throat."
"""It was poison that killed him, my lords,"" said Ballabar, as Frenken 
nodded gravely."
"Then they brought forth Grand Maester Pycelle, leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as he 
Page 588

walked, a few white hairs sprouting from his long chicken's neck."
"He had grown too frail to stand, so the 
judges permitted a chair to be brought in for him, and a table as well."
"On the table were laid a number of 
small jars."
Pycelle was pleased to put a name to each.
"""Greycap,"" he said in a quavery voice, ""from the toadstool."
"Nightshade, sweetsleep, demon's dance."
This is blindeye.
"Widow's blood, this one is called, for the color."
A cruel potion.
"It shuts down a man's 
bladder and bowels, until he drowns in his own poisons."
"This wolfsbane, here basilisk venom, and this 
one the tears of Lys."
Yes.
I know them all.
"The Imp Tyrion Lannister stole them from my chambers, 
when he had me falsely imprisoned."""
"""Pycelle,"" Tyrion called out, risking his father's wrath, ""could any of these poisons choke off a man's 
breath?"""
"""No."
"For that, you must turn to a rarer poison."
"When I was a boy at the Citadel, my teachers named it 
simply the strangler."""
"""But this rare poison was not found, was it?"""
"""No, my lord."""
Pycelle blinked at him.
"""You used it all to kill the noblest child the gods ever put on this 
good earth."""
Tyrion's anger overwhelmed his sense.
"""Joffrey was cruel and stupid, but I did not kill him."
"Have my 
head off if you like, I had no hand in my nephew's death."""
"""Silence!"""
Lord Tywin said.
"""I have told you thrice."
"The next time, you shall be gagged and chained."""
"After Pycelle came the procession, endless and wearisome."
"Lords and ladies and noble knights, 
highborn and humble alike, they had all been present at the wedding feast, had all seen Joffrey choke, his 
face turning as black as a Dornish plum."
"Lord Redwyne, Lord Celtigar, and Ser Flement Brax had heard 
Tyrion threaten the king; two serving men, a juggler, Lord Gyles, Ser Hobber Redwyne, and Ser Philip 
Foote had observed him fill the wedding chalice; Lady Merryweather swore that she had seen the dwarf 
drop something into the king's wine while Joff and Margaery were cutting the pie; old Estermont, young 
Peckledon, the singer Galyeon of Cuy, and the squires Morros and Jothos Slynt told how Tyrion had 
picked up the chalice as Joff was dying and poured out the last of the poisoned wine onto the floor."
When did I make so many enemies?
Lady Merryweather was all but a stranger.
"Tyrion wondered if she 
was blind or bought."
"At least Galyeon 
of Cuy had not set his account to music, or else there might have been seventy-seven bloody verses to it."
"When his uncle called that night after supper, his manner was cold and distant."
He thinks I did it too.
"""Do 
you have witnesses for us?"""
Ser Kevan asked him.
"""Not as such, no."
"Unless you've found my wife."""
His uncle shook his head.
"""It would seem the trial is going very badly for you."""
"""Oh, do you think so?"
"I hadn't noticed."""
Tyrion fingered his scar.
"""Varys has not come."""
"""Nor will he."
"On the morrow he testifies against you."""
"Page 589

Lovely."
"""I see."""
He shifted in his seat.
"""I am curious."
"You were always a fair man, Uncle."
"What 
convinced you?"""
"""Why steal Pycelle's poisons, if not to use them?"""
Ser Kevan said bluntly.
"""And Lady Merryweather saw 
- "" 
"" - nothing!"
There was nothing to see.
But how do I prove that?
"How do I prove anything, penned up 
here?"""
"""Perhaps the time has come for you to confess."""
"Even through the thick stone walls of the Red Keep, Tyrion could hear the steady wash of rain."
"""Say that 
again, Uncle?"
"I could swear you urged me to confess."""
"""If you were to admit your guilt before the throne and repent of your crime, your father would withhold 
the sword."
"You would be permitted to take the black."""
Tyrion laughed in his face.
"""Those were the same terms Cersei offered Eddard Stark."
"We all know how 
that ended."""
"""Your father had no part in that."""
"That much was true, at least."
"""Castle Black teems with murderers, thieves and rapists,"" Tyrion said, ""but 
I don't recall meeting many regicides while I was there."
"You expect me to believe that if I admit to being 
a kinslayer and kingslayer, my father will simply nod, forgive me, and pack me off to the Wall with some 
warm woolen smallclothes."""
He hooted rudely.
"""Naught was said of forgiveness,"" Ser Kevan said sternly."
"""A confession would put this matter to rest."
"It 
is for that reason your father sends me with this offer."""
"""Thank him kindly for me, Uncle,"" said Tyrion, ""but tell him I am not presently in a confessing mood."""
"""Were I you, I'd change my mood."
"Your sister wants your head, and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to 
give it to her."""
"""So one of my judges has already condemned me, without hearing a word in my defense?"""
"It was no 
more than he expected."
"""Will I still be allowed to speak and present witnesses?"""
"""You have no witnesses,"" his uncle reminded him."
"""Tyrion, if you are guilty of this enormity, the Wall is a 
kinder fate than you deserve."
"And if you are blameless ... there is fighting in the north, I know, but even 
so it will be a safer place for you than King's Landing, whatever the outcome of this trial."
"The mob is 
convinced of your guilt."
"Were you so foolish as to venture out into the streets, they would tear you limb 
from limb."""
"""I can see how much that prospect upsets you."""
"""You are my brother's son."""
"""You might remind him of that."""
"""Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you were not his own blood, and Joanna's?"
"Tywin 
Page 590

seems a hard man to you, I know, but he is no harder than he's had to be."
"Our own father was gentle and 
amiable, but so weak his bannermen mocked him in their cups."
Some saw fit to defy him openly.
"Other 
lords borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay it."
At court they japed of toothless lions.
"Even his 
mistress stole from him."
"A woman scarcely one step above a whore, and she helped herself to my 
mother's jewels!"
It fell to Tywin to restore House Lannister to its proper place.
"just as it fell to him to rule 
this realm, when he was no more than twenty."
"He bore that heavy burden for twenty years, and all it 
earned him was a mad king's envy."
"Instead of the honor he deserved, he was made to suffer slights 
beyond count, yet he gave the Seven Kingdoms peace, plenty, and justice."
He is a just man.
"You would 
be wise to trust him."""
Tyrion blinked in astonishment.
"Ser Kevan had always been solid, stolid, pragmatic; he had never heard 
him speak with such fervor before."
"""You love him."""
"""He is my brother."""
"""I ..."
"I will think on what you've said."""
"""Think carefully, then."
"And quickly."""
"He thought of little else that night, but come morning was no closer to deciding if his father could be 
trusted."
"A servant brought him porridge and honey to break his fast, but all he could taste was bile at the 
thought of confession."
They will call me kinslayer till the end of my days.
"For a thousand years or more, if 
I am remembered at all, it will be as the monstrous dwarf who poisoned his young nephew at his wedding 
feast."
"The thought made him so bloody angry that he flung the bowl and spoon across the room and left a 
smear of porridge on the wall."
"Ser Addam Marbrand looked at it curiously when he came to escort 
Tyrion to trial, but had the good grace not to inquire."
"""Lord Varys,"" the herald said, ""master of whisperers."""
"Powdered, primped, and smelling of rosewater, the Spider rubbed his hands one over the other all the 
time he spoke."
"Washing my life away, 
Tyrion thought, as he listened to the eunuch's mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part 
Joffrey from the Hound's protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tornmen as king."
Half-truths are worth more than outright lies.
"And unlike the others, Varys had documents; parchments 
painstakingly filled with notes, details, dates, whole conversations."
"So much material that its recitation 
took all day, and so much of it damning."
"Varys confirmed Tyrion's midnight visit to Grand Maester 
Pycelle's chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions, confirmed the threat he'd made to Cersei the 
night of their supper, confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself."
"When Prince Oberyn asked 
him how he could possibly know all this, not having been present at any of these events, the eunuch only 
giggled and said, ""My little birds told me."
"Knowing is their purpose, and mine."""
How do I question a little bird?
thought Tyrion.
"I should have had the eunuch's head off my first day in 
King's Landing."
Damn him.
And damn me for whatever trust I put in him.
"""Have we heard it all?"""
Lord Tywin asked his daughter as Varys left the hall.
"""Almost,"" said Cersei."
"""I beg your leave to bring one final witness before you, on the morrow."""
"""As you wish,"" Lord Tywin said."
"Page 591

Oh, good, thought Tyrion savagely."
"After this farce of a trial, execution will almost come as a relief."
"That night, as he sat by his window drinking, he heard voices outside his door."
"Ser Kevan, come for my 
answer, he thought at once, but it was not his uncle who entered."
Tyrion rose to give Prince Oberyn a mocking bow.
"""Are judges permitted to visit the accused?"""
"""Princes are permitted to go where they will."
"Or so I told your guards."""
The Red Viper took a seat.
"""My father will be displeased with you."""
"""The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on my list of concerns."
"Is it Domish wine you're 
drinking?"""
"""From the Arbor."""
Oberyn made a face.
"""Red water."
"Did you poison him?"""
"""No."
"Did you?"""
The prince smiled.
"""Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours?"
"Someone is going to cut it out one of these 
days."""
"""You are not the first to tell me that."
"Perhaps I should cut it out myself, it seems to make no end of 
trouble."""
"""So I've seen."
"I think I may drink some of Lord Redwyne's grape juice after all."""
"""As you like."""
Tyrion served him a cup.
"The man took a sip, sloshed it about in his mouth, and swallowed."
"""it will serve, for the moment."
"I will 
send you up some strong Domish wine on the morrow."""
He took another sip.
"""I have turned up that 
goldenhaired whore I was hoping for."""
"""So you found Chataya's?"""
"""At Chataya's I bedded the black-skinned girl."
"Alayaya, I believe she is called."
"Exquisite, despite the 
stripes on her back."
"But the whore I referred to is your sister."""
"""Has she seduced you yet?"""
"Tyrion asked, unsurprised."
Oberyn laughed aloud.
"""No, but she will if I meet her price."
The queen has even hinted at marriage.
"Her 
Grace needs another husband, and who better than a prince of Dome?"
Ellaria believes I should accept.
"just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes her wet, the randy wench."
"And we should not even need to 
pay the dwarf's penny."
"All your sister requires from me is one head, somewhat overlarge and missing a 
nose."""
"""And?"""
"said Tyrion, waiting."
"By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine, and said, ""When the Young Dragon conquered 
Dome so long ago, he left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear."
"This Tyrell

moved with his tail from keep to keep, chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent."
"He 
would arrive in force, take a castle for his own, stay a moon's turn, and ride on to the next castle."
"It was 
his custom to turn the lords out of their own chambers and take their beds for himself."
"One night he found 
himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy."
"A sash hung down near the pillows, should he wish to summon a 
wench."
"He had a taste for Domish women, this Lord Tyrell, and who can blame him?"
"So he pulled upon 
the sash, and when he did the canopy above him split open, and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon 
his head."
"His death lit a fire that soon swept across Dome, undoing all the Young Dragon's victories in a 
fortnight."
"The kneeling men stood up, and we were free again."""
"""I know the tale,"" said Tyrion."
"""What of it?"""
"""Just this."
"if I should ever find a sash beside my own bed, and pull on it, I would sooner have the 
scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty."""
Tyrion grinned.
"""We have that much in common, then."""
"""To be sure, I have much to thank your sister for."
"if not for her accusation at the feast, it might well be 
you judging me instead of me judging you."""
The prince's eyes were dark with amusement.
"""Who knows 
more of poison than the Red Viper of Dome, after all?"
"Who has better reason to want to keep the Tyrells 
far from the crown?"
"And with Joffrey in his grave, by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his 
sister Myrcella, who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew, thanks to you."""
"""Domish law does not apply."""
"Tyrion had been so ensnared in his own 
troubles that he'd never stopped to consider the succession."
"""My father will crown Tommen, count on 
that."""
"""He may indeed crown Tommen, here in King's Landing."
"Which is not to say that my brother may not 
crown Myrcella, down in Sunspear."
Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your nephew?
"Will your sister?"""
He gave a shrug.
"""Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all, on the condition that 
she support her daughter over her son."
"Do you think she would?"""
"Never, Tyrion wanted to say, but the word caught in his throat."
"Cersei always resented being excluded 
from power on account of her sex."
"If Dornish law applied in the west, she would be the heir to Casterly 
Rock in her own right."
"She and Jaime were twins, but Cersei had come first into the world, and that was 
all it took."
By championing Myrcella's cause she would be championing her own.
"""I do not know how my 
sister would choose, between Tornmen and Myrcella,"" he admitted."
"""It makes no matter."
"My father will 
never give her that choice."""
"""Your father,"" said Prince Oberyn, ""may not live forever."""
Something about the way he said it made the hairs on the back of Tyrion's neck bristle.
"Suddenly he was 
mindful of Elia again, and all that Oberyn had said as they crossed the field of ashes."
"He wants the head 
that spoke the words, not just the hand that swung the sword."
"""It is not wise to speak such treasons in 
the Red Keep, my prince."
"The little birds are listening."""
"""Let them."
is it treason to say a man is mortal?
Valar morghulis was how they said it in Valyria of old.
"All 
men must die."
"And the Doom came and proved it true."""
"The Dornishman went to the window to gaze out 
into the night."
"""It is being said that you have no witnesses for us."""
"""I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be enough to persuade you all of my 
Page 593

innocence."""
"""You are mistaken, my lord."
"The Fat Flower of Highgarden is quite convinced of your guilt, and 
determined to see you die."
"His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too, as he has reminded 
us half a hundred times."""
"""And you?"""
said Tyrion.
"""Men are seldom as they appear."
You look so very guilty that I am convinced of your innocence.
"Still, 
you will likely be condemned."
justice is in short supply this side of the mountains.
"There has been none 
for Elia, Aegon, or Rhaenys."
Why should there be any for you?
"Perhaps Joffrey's real killer was eaten by 
a bear."
That seems to happen quite often in King's Landing.
"Oh, wait, the bear was at Harrenhal, now I 
remember."""
"""Is that the game we are playing?"""
Tyrion rubbed at his scarred nose.
"He had nothing to lose by telling 
Oberyn the truth."
"""There was a bear at Harrenhal, and it did kill Ser Amory Lorch."""
"""How sad for him,"" said the Red Viper."
"""And for you."
"Do all noseless men lie so badly, I wonder?"""
"""I am not lying."
"Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her father's bed and stabbed her 
to death."
"He had some men-at-arms with him, but I do not know their names."""
He leaned forward.
"""It 
was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon's head against a wall and raped your sister Elia 
with his blood and brains still on his hands."""
"""What is this, now?"
"Truth, from a Lannister?"""
Oberyn smiled coldly.
"""Your father gave the commands, 
yes?"""
"""No."""
"He spoke the lie without hesitation, and never stopped to ask himself why he should."
The Domishman raised one thin black eyebrow.
"""Such a dutiful son."
And such a very feeble lie.
"It was 
Lord Tywin who presented my sister's children to King Robert all wrapped up in crimson Lannister 
cloaks."""
"""Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father."
He was there.
"I was at the Rock, and still so 
young that I thought the thing between my legs was only good for pissing."""
"""Yes, but you are here now, and in some difficulty, I would say."
"Your innocence may be as plain as the 
scar on your face, but it will not save you."
"No more than your father will."""
The Dornish prince smiled.
"""But I might."""
"""You?"""
Tyrion studied him.
"""You are one judge in three."
"How could you save me?"""
"""Not as your judge."
"As your champion."""
"Chapter 67 
Jaime 
Page 594

A white book sat on a white table in a white room."
"The room was round, its walls of whitewashed stone hung with white woolen tapestries."
"It formed the 
first floor of White Sword Tower, a slender structure of four stories built into an angle of the castle wall 
overlooking the bay."
"The undercroft held arms and armor, the second and third floors the small spare 
sleeping cells of the six brothers of the Kingsguard."
"One of those cells had been his for eighteen years, but this morning he had moved his things to the 
topmost floor, which was given over entirely to the Lord Commander's apartments."
"Those rooms were 
spare as well, though spacious; and they were above the outer walls, which meant he would have a view 
of the sea."
"I will like that, he thought."
"The view, and all the rest."
"As pale as the room, Jaime sat by the book in his Kingsguard whites, waiting for his Sworn Brothers."
"A 
longsword hung from his hip."
From the wrong hip.
"Before he had always wom his sword on his left, and 
drawn it across his body when he unsheathed."
"He had shifted it to his right hip this morning, so as to be 
able to draw it with his left hand in the same manner, but the weight of it felt strange there, and when he 
had tried to pull the blade from the scabbard the whole motion seemed clumsy and unnatural."
"His clothing 
fit badly as well."
"He had donned the winter raiment of the Kingsguard, a tunic and breeches of bleached 
white wool and a heavy white cloak, but it all seemed to hang loose on him."
"Jaime had spent his days at his brother's trial, standing well to the 
back of the hall."
"Either Tyrion never saw him there or he did not know him, but that was no surprise."
Half the court no longer seemed to know him.
I am a stranger in my own House.
"His son was dead, his 
father had disowned him, and his sister ... she had not allowed him to be alone with her once, after that 
first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles."
"Even when they bore him across the city 
to his tomb in the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei kept a careful distance."
He looked about the Round Room once more.
"White wool hangings covered the walls, and there was a 
white shield and two crossed longswords mounted above the hearth."
"The chair behind the table was old 
black oak, with cushions of blanched cowhide, the leather worn thin."
"Worn by the bony arse of Barristan 
the Bold and Ser Gerold Hightower before him, by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, Ser Ryam 
Redwyne, and the Demon of Darry, by Ser Duncan the Tall and the Pale Griffin Alyn Connington."
"How 
could the Kingslayer belong in such exalted company?"
Yet here he was.
"The table itself was old weirwood, pale as bone, carved in the shape of a huge shield supported by three 
white stallions."
"By tradition the Lord Commander sat at the top of the shield, and the brothers three to a 
side, on the rare occasions when all seven were assembled."
"The book that rested by his elbow was 
massive; two feet tall and a foot and a half wide, a thousand pages thick, fine white vellum bound 
between covers of bleached white leather with gold hinges and fastenings."
"The Book of the Brothers was 
its formal name, but more often it was simply called the White Book."
Within the White Book was the history of the Kingsguard.
"Every knight who'd ever served had a page, 
to record his name and deeds for all time."
"On the top left-hand corner of each page was drawn the shield 
the man had carried at the time he was chosen, inked in rich colors."
"Down in the bottom right corner was 
the shield of the Kingsguard; snow-white, empty, pure."
"The upper shields were all different; the lower 
shields were all the same."
in the space between were written the facts of each man's life and service.
"The 
heraldic drawings and illuminations were done by septons sent from the Great Sept of Baelor three times 
Page 595

a year, but it was the duty of the Lord Commander to keep the entries up to date."
"My duty, now Once he learned to write with his left hand, that is."
The White Book was well behind.
"The 
deaths of Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Preston Greenfield needed to be entered, and the brief bloody 
Kingsguard service of Sandor Clegane as well."
"New pages must be started for Ser Balon Swann, Ser 
Osmund Kettleblack, and the Knight of Flowers."
I will need to summon a septon to draw their shields.
Ser Barristan Selmy had preceded Jaime as Lord Commander.
"The shield atop his page showed the 
arms of House Selmy: three stalks of 
wheat, yellow, on a brown field."
"Jaime was amused, though unsurprised, to find that Ser Barristan had 
taken the time to record his own dismissal before leaving the castle."
Ser Barristan of House Selmy.
Firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy of Harvest Hall.
"Served as squire to 
Ser Manfred Swann."
"Named ""the Bold"" in his 1 Oth year, when he donned borrowed armor to appear 
as a mystery knight in the tourney at Blackhaven, where he was defeated and unmasked by Duncan, 
Prince of Dragonflies."
"Knighted in his 16th year by King Aegon V Targaryen, after performing great feats 
of prowess as a mystery knight in the winter tourney at King's Landing, defeating Prince Duncan the 
Small and Ser Duncan the Tall, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
"Slew Maelys the Monstrous, last of 
the Blackfyre Pretenders, in single combat during the War of the Ninepenny Kings."
"Defeated Lormelle 
Long Lance and Cedrik Storm, the Bastard of Bronzegate."
"Named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year, 
by Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower."
"Defended the passage against all challengers in the tourney 
of the Silver Bridge."
Victor in the m6l6e at Maidenpool.
"Brought King Aerys II to safety during the 
Defiance of Duskendale, despite an arrow wound in the chest."
"Avenged the murder of his Sworn 
Brother, Ser Gwayne Gaunt."
"Rescued Lady feyne Swann and her septa from the Kingswood 
Brotherhood, defeating Simon Toyne and the Smiling Knight, and slaying the former."
"In the Oldtown 
tourney, defeated and unmasked the mystery knight Blackshield, revealing him as the Bastard of 
Uplands."
"Sole champion of Lord Steffon's tourney at Storm's End, whereat he unhorsed Lord Robert 
Baratheon, Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord [on Connington, Lord Jason Mallister, 
and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen."
"Wounded by arrow, spear, and sword at the Battle of the Trident whilst 
fighting beside his Sworn Brothers and Rhaegar Prince of Dragonstone."
"Pardoned, and named Lord 
Commander of the Kingsguard, by King Robert I Baratheon."
"Served in the honor guard that brought 
Lady Cersei of House Lannister to King's Landing to wed King Robert."
"Led the attack on Old Wyk 
during Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion."
"Champion of the tourney at King's Landing, in his 57th year."
"Dismissed from service by King loffrey I Baratheon in his 61st year, for reasons of advanced age."
"The earlier part of Ser Barristan's storied career had been entered by Ser Gerold Hightower in a big 
forceful hand."
"Selmy's own smaller and more elegant writing took over with the account of his wounding 
on the Trident."
Jaime's own page was scant by comparison.
Ser Jaime of House Lannister.
Firstborn son of Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna of Casterly Rock.
"Served 
against the 
Kingswood Brotherhood as squire to Lord Sumner Crakehall."
"Knighted in his 15th year by Ser Arthur 
Dayne of the 
Kingsguard, for valor in the field."
"Chosen for the Kingsguard in his 15th year by King Aerys II 
Targaryen."
"During the 
Page 596

Sack of King's Landing, slew King Aerys II at the foot of the Iron Throne."
"Thereafter known as the 
""Kingslayer."""
Pardoned for his crime by King Robert I Baratheon.
"Served in the honor guard that brought his sister the 
Lady Cersei 
Lannister to King's Landing to wed King Robert."
"Champion in the tourney held at King's Landing on the 
occasion of 
their wedding."
"Summed up like that, his life seemed a rather scant and mingy thing."
"Ser Barristan could have recorded a 
few of his other tourney victories, at least."
"And Ser Gerold might have written a few more words about 
the deeds he'd performed when Ser Arthur Dayne broke the Kingswood Brotherhood."
"He had saved 
Lord Sumner's life as Big Belly Ben was about to smash his head in, though the outlaw had escaped him."
"And he'd held his own against the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser Arthur who slew him."
"What a fight 
that was, and what a foe."
"The Smiling Knight was a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up 
together, but he did not know the meaning of fear."
"And Dayne, with Dawn in hand ..."
"The outlaw's 
longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one."
"""It's 
that white sword of yours I want,"" the robber knight told him as they resumed, though he was bleeding 
from a dozen wounds by then."
"""Then you shall have it, ser,"" the Sword of the Morning replied, and made 
an end of it."
"The world was simpler in those days, Jaime thought, and men as well as swords were made of finer 
steel."
Or was it only that he had been fifteen?
"They were all in their graves now, the Sword of the 
Morning and the Smiling Knight, the White Bull and Prince Lewyn, Ser Oswell Whent with his black 
humor, earnest Jon Darry, Simon Toyne and his Kingswood Brotherhood, bluff old Sumner Crakehall."
"And me, that boy I was ... when did he die, I wonder?"
When I donned the white cloak?
"When I opened 
Aerys's throat?"
"That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had 
become the Smiling Knight instead."
"When he heard the door open, he closed the White Book and stood to receive his Sworn Brothers."
"Ser 
Osmund Kettleblack was the first to arrive."
"He gave Jaime a grin, as if they were old brothers-in-arms."
"""Ser Jaime,"" he said, ""had you looked like this t'other night, I'd have known you at once."""
"""Would you indeed?"""
Jaime doubted that.
"The servants had bathed him, shaved him, and washed and 
brushed his hair."
"When he looked in a glass, he no longer saw the man who had crossed the riverlands 
with 
Brienne ... but he did not see himself either."
"His face was thin and hollow, and he had lines under his 
eyes."
I look like some old man.
"""Stand by your seat, ser."""
Kettleblack complied.
The other Sworn Brothers filed in one by one.
"""Sers,"" Jaime said in a formal tone 
when all five had assembled, ""who guards the king?"""
"""My brothers Ser Osney and Ser Osfryd,"" Ser Osmund replied."
"""And my brother Ser Garlan,"" said the Knight of Flowers."
"""Will they keep him safe?"""
"Page 597

""They will, my lord."""
"""Be seated, then."""
The words were ritual.
"Before the seven could meet in session, the king's safety must 
be assured."
"Ser Boros and Ser Meryn sat to his right, leaving an empty chair between them for Ser Arys Oakheart, 
off in Dorne."
"Ser Osmund, Ser Balon, and Ser Loras took the seats to his left."
The old and the new.
Jaime wondered if that meant anything.
"There had been times during its history where the Kingsguard had 
been divided against itself, most notably and bitterly during the Dance of the Dragons."
"Was that 
something he needed to fear as well?"
"It seemed queer to him to sit in the Lord Commander's seat where Barristan the Bold had sat for so 
many years."
And even queerer to sit here crippled.
"Nonetheless, it was his seat, and this was his 
Kingsguard now."
Tommen's seven.
"Jaime had served with Meryn Trant and Boros Blount for years; adequate fighters, but Trant was sly and 
cruel, and Blount a bag of growly air."
"Ser Balon Swann was better suited to his cloak, and of course the 
Knight of Flowers was supposedly all a knight should be."
"The fifth man was a stranger to him, this 
Osmund Kettleblack."
He wondered what Ser Arthur Dayne would have to say of this lot.
"""How is it that the Kingsguard has 
fallen so low,"" most like."
"""It was my doing, "" I would have to answer."
"""I opened the door, and did nothing 
when the vermin began to crawl inside."""
"""The king is dead, "" Jaime began."
"""My sister's son, a boy of thirteen, murdered at his own wedding feast 
in his own hall."
All five of you were present.
All five of you were protecting him.
"And yet he's dead."""
"He 
waited to see what they would say to that, but none of them so much as cleared a throat."
"The Tyrell boy 
is angry, and Balon Swann's ashamed, he judged."
From the other three Jaime sensed only indifference.
"""Did my brother do this thing?"
he asked them bluntly.
"""Did Tyrion poison my nephew?"""
Ser Balon shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Ser Boros made a fist.
Ser Osmund gave a lazy shrug.
"It 
was Meryn Trant who finally answered."
"""He filled Joffrey's cup with wine."
"That must have been when he 
slipped the poison in."""
"""You are certain it was the wine that was poisoned?"""
"""What else?"""
said Ser Boros Blount.
"""The Imp emptied the dregs on the floor."
"Why, but to spill the wine 
that might have proved him guilty?"""
"""He knew the wine was poisoned,"" said Ser Meryn."
Ser Balon Swann frowned.
"""The Imp was not alone on the dais."
Far from it.
"That late in the feast, we 
had people standing and moving about, changing places, slipping off to the privy, servants were coming 
and going ... the king and queen had just opened the wedding pie, every eye was on them or those 
thrice-damned doves."
"No one was watching the wine cup."""
"""Who else was on the dais?"""
asked Jaime.
Ser Meryn answered.
"""The king's family, the bride's family, Grand Maester Pycelle, the High Septon ."
.
.
"Page 598

"" 
""There's your poisoner,"" suggested Ser Oswald Kettleblack with a sly grin."
"""Too holy by half, that old 
man."
"Never liked the look o' him, myself."""
He laughed.
"""No,"" the Knight of Flowers said, unamused."
"""Sansa Stark was the poisoner."
"You all forget, my sister 
was drinking from that chalice as well."
"Sansa Stark was the only person in the hall who had reason to 
want Margaery dead, as well as the king."
"By poisoning the wedding cup, she could hope to kill both of 
them."
"And why did she run afterward, unless she was guilty?"""
The boy makes sense.
Tyrion might yet be innocent.
"No one was any closer to finding the girl, however."
Perhaps Jaime should look into that himself.
"For a start, it would be good to know how she had gotten 
out of the castle."
Varys may have a notion or two about that.
"No one knew the Red Keep better than the 
eunuch."
"That could wait, however."
just now Jaime had more immediate concerns.
"You say you are the Lord 
Commander of the Kingsguard, his father had said."
Go do your duty.
"These five were not the brothers he 
would have chosen, but they were the brothers he had; the time had come to take them in hand."
"""Whoever did it,"" he told them, ""Joffrey is dead, and the iron Throne belongs to Tornmen now."
"I mean 
for him to sit on it until his hair turns white and his teeth fall out."
"And not from poison."""
"Jaime turned to 
Ser Boros Blount."
"The man had grown stout in recent years, though he was big-boned enough to carry it."
"""Ser Boros, you look like a man who enjoys his food."
"Henceforth you'll taste everything Tommen eats or 
drinks."""
"Ser Osmund Kettleblack laughed aloud and the Knight of Flowers smiled, but Ser Boros turned a deep 
beet red."
"""I am no food taster!"
"I am a knight of the Kingsguard!"""
"""Sad to say, you are."""
Cersei should never have stripped the man of his white cloak.
"But their father had 
only compounded the shame by 
restoring it."
"""My sister has told me how readily you yielded my nephew to Tyrion's sellswords."
"You will 
find carrots and pease less threatening, I hope."
"When your Sworn Brothers are training in the yard with 
sword and shield, you may train with spoon and trencher."
Tornmen loves applecakes.
"Try not to let any 
sellswords make off with them."""
"""You speak to me thus?"
"You?"""
"""You should have died before you let Tommen be taken."""
"""As you died protecting Aerys, ser? """
"Ser Boros lurched to his feet, and clasped the hilt of his sword."
"""I 
won't ..."
I won't suffer this.
"You should be the food taster, it seems to me."
"What else is a cripple good 
for?"""
Jaime smiled.
"""I agree."
I am as unfit to guard the king as you are.
"So draw that sword you're fondling, 
and we shall see how your two hands fare against my one."
"At the end one of us will be dead, and the 
Kingsguard."
"will be improved."""
He rose.
"""Or, if you prefer, you may return to your duties."""
"""Bah!"""
"Ser Boros hawked up a glob of green phlegm, spat it at Jaime's feet, and walked out, his sword 
still in its sheath."
"Page 599

The man is craven, and a good thing."
"Though fat, aging, and never more than ordinary, Ser Boros could 
still have hacked him into bloody pieces."
"But Boros does not know that, and neither must the rest."
"They 
feared the man I was; the man I am they'd pity."
Jaime seated himself again and turned to Kettleblack.
"""Ser Osmund."
I do not know you.
"I find that 
curious."
"I've fought in tourneys, m6l6es, and battles throughout the Seven Kingdoms."
"I know of every 
hedge knight, freerider, and upjumped squire of any skill who has ever presumed to break a lance in the 
lists."
"So how is it that I have never heard of you, Ser Osmund?"""
"""That I couldn't say, my lord."""
"He had a great wide smile on his face, did Ser Osmund, as if he and 
Jaime were old comrades in arms playing some jolly little game."
"""I'm a soldier, though, not no tourney 
knight."""
"""Where had you served, before my sister found you?"""
"""Here and there, my lord."""
"""I have been to Oldtown in the south and Winterfell in the north."
"I have been to Lannisport in the west, 
and King's Landing in the east."
But I have never been to Here.
"Nor There."""
"For want of a finger, Jaime 
pointed his stump at Ser Osmund's beak of a nose."
"""I will ask once more."
"Where have you served?"""
"""In the Stepstones."
Some in the Disputed Lands.
There's always fighting there.
"I rode with the Gallant 
Men."
"We fought for Lys, and some for Tyrosh."""
You fought for anyone who would pay you.
"""How did you come by your knighthood?"""
"""On a battlefield."""
"""Who knighted you?"""
"""Ser Robert ... Stone."
"He's dead now, my lord."""
"""To be sure."""
"Ser Robert Stone might have been some bastard from the Vale, he supposed, selling his 
sword in the Disputed Lands."
"On the other hand, he might be no more than a name Ser Osmund cobbled 
together from a dead king and a castle wall."
"What was Gersei thinking when she gave this one a white 
cloak?"
At least Kettleblack would likely know how to use a sword and shield.
"Sellswords were seldom the 
most honorable of men, but they had to have a certain skill at arms to stay alive."
"""Very well, ser,"" Jaime 
said."
"""You may go."""
The man's grin returned.
He left swaggering.
"""Ser Meryn."""
Jaime smiled at the sour knight with the rust-red hair and the pouches under his eyes.
"""I 
have heard it said that Joffrey made use of you to chastise Sansa Stark."""
"He turned the White Book 
around one-handed."
"""Here, show me where it is in our vows that we swear to beat women and children."""
"""I did as His Grace commanded me."
"We are sworn to obey."""
"""Henceforth you will temper that obedience."
My sister is Queen Regent.
My father is the King's Hand.
"I 
am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
Obey us.
"None other."""
"Page 600

Ser Meryn got a stubborn look on his face."
"""Are you telling us not to obey the king?"""
"""The king is eight."
"Our first duty is to protect him, which includes protecting him from himself."
"Use that 
ugly thing you keep inside your helm."
"If Tommen wants you to saddle his horse, obey him."
"If he tells you 
to kill his horse, come to me."""
"""Aye."
"As you command, my lord."""
"""Dismissed."""
"As he left, Jaime turned to Ser Balon Swann."
"""Ser Balon, I have watched you tilt many a 
time, and fought with and against you in melees."
"I'm told you proved your valor a hundred times over 
during the Battle of the Blackwater."
"The Kingsguard is honored by your presence."""
"""The honor's mine, my lord."""
Ser Balon sounded wary.
"""There is only one question I would put to you."
"You served us loyally, it's true ... but Varys tells me that 
your brother rode with Renly and then Stannis, whilst your lord father chose not to call his banners at all 
and remained behind the walls of Stonehelm all through the fighting."""
"""My father is an old man, my lord."
Well past forty.
"His fighting days are done."""
"""And your brother?"""
"""Donnel was wounded in the battle and yielded to Ser Elwood Harte."
"He was ransomed afterward and 
pledged his fealty to King Joffrey, as did many other captives."""
"""So he did,"" said Jaime."
"""Even so ... Renly, Stannis, Joffrey, Tommen how did he come to omit Balon 
Greyjoy and Robb Stark?"
"He might have been the first knight in the realm to swear fealty to all six kings."""
Ser Balon's unease was plain.
"""Donnel erred, but he is Tommen's man now."
"You have my word."""
"""It's not Ser Donnel the Constant who concerns me."
"It's you."""
Jaime leaned forward.
"""What will you do 
if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper, and one day comes storming into the throne 
room?"
"And there you stand all in white, between your king and your blood."
"What will you do?"""
"""I ... my lord, that will never happen."""
"""It happened to me,"" Jaime said."
Swann wiped his brow with the sleeve of his white tunic.
"""You have no answer?"""
"""My lord."""
Ser Balon drew himself up.
"""On my sword, on my honor, on my father's name, I swear ..."
"I 
shall not do as you did."""
Jaime laughed.
"""Good."
"Return to your duties ... and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to his shield."""
And then he was alone with the Knight of Flowers.
"Slim as a sword, lithe and fit, Ser Loras Tyrell wore a snowy linen tunic and white wool breeches, with a 
Page 601

gold belt around his waist and a gold rose clasping his fine silk cloak."
"His hair was a soft brown tumble, 
and his eyes were brown as well, and bright with insolence."
"He thinks this is a tourney, and his tilt has just 
been called."
"""Seventeen and a knight of the Kingsguard,"" said Jaime."
"""You must be proud."
"Prince Ae n 
the Dragonknight was seventeen when he was named."
"Did you know that? """
"""Yes, my lord."""
"""And did you know that I was fifteen?"""
"""That as well, my lord."""
He smiled.
Jaime hated that smile.
"""I was better than you, Ser Loras."
"I was bigger, I was stronger, and I was 
quicker."""
"""And now you're older,"" the boy said."
"""My lord."""
He had to laugh.
This is too absurd.
"Tyrion would mock me unmercifully if he could hear me now, 
comparing cocks with this green boy."
"""Older and wiser, ser."
"You should learn from me."""
"""As you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn?"""
That arrow hit too close to the mark.
"""I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold,"" Jaime 
snapped."
"""I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of 
you with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right."
"I learned from Prince Lewyn of 
Dome and Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Jonothor Darry, good men every one."""
"""Dead men, every one."""
"He's me, Jaime realized suddenly."
"I am speaking to myself, as I was, all cocksure arrogance and empty 
chivalry."
"This is what it does to you, to be too good too young."
"As in a swordfight, sometimes it is best to try a different stroke."
"""It's said you fought magnificently in the 
battle ... almost as well as Lord Renly's ghost beside you."
"A Sworn Brother has no secrets from his Lord 
Commander."
"Tell me, ser."
"Who was wearing Renly's armor?"""
"For a moment Loras Tyrell looked as though he might refuse, but in the end he remembered his vows."
"""My brother,"" he said sullenly."
"""Renly was taller than me, and broader in the chest."
"His armor was too 
loose on me, but it suited Garlan well."""
"""Was the masquerade your notion, or his?"""
"""Lord Littlefinger suggested it."
"He said it would frighten Stannis's ignorant men-at-arms."""
"""And so it did."""
And some knights and lordlings too.
"""Well, you gave the singers something to make 
rhymes about, I suppose that's not to be despised."
"What did you do with Renly?"""
"""I buried him with mine own hands, in a place he showed me once when I was a squire at Storm's End."
"No one shall ever find him there to disturb his rest."""
He looked at Jaime defiantly.
"""I will defend King 
Tommen with all my strength, I swear it."
I will give my life for his if need be.
"But I will never betray Renly, 
by word or deed."
He was the king that should have been.
"He was the best of them."""
"Page 602

The best dressed perhaps, Jaime thought, but for once he did not say it."
"The arrogance had gone out of 
Ser Loras the moment he began to speak of Renly."
He answered truly.
"He is proud and reckless and full 
of piss, but he is not false."
Not yet.
"""As you say."
"One more thing, and you may return to your duties."""
"""Yes, my lord?"""
"""I still have Brienne of Tarth in a tower cell."""
The boy's mouth hardened.
"""A black cell would be better."""
"""You are certain that's what she deserves?"""
"""She deserves death."
I told Renly that a woman had no place in the Rainbow Guard.
"She won the melee 
with a trick."""
"""I seem to recall another knight who was fond of tricks."
"He once rode a mare in heat against a foe 
mounted on a badtempered stallion."
"What sort of trickery did Brienne use?"""
Ser Loras flushed.
"""She leapt ... it makes no matter."
"She won, I grant her that."
"His Grace put a rainbow 
cloak around her shoulders."
"And she killed him, Or let him die."""
"""A large difference there."""
"The difference between my crime and the shame of Boros Blount, 
""She had sworn to protect him."
"Ser Emmon Cuy, Ser Robar Royce, Ser Parmen Crane, they'd swom as 
well."
"How could anyone have hurt him, with her inside his tent and the others just outside?"
"Unless they 
were part of it."""
"""There were five of you at the wedding feast,"" Jaime pointed out."
"""How could Joffrey die?"
"Unless you 
were part of it?"""
Ser Loras drew himself up stiffly.
"""There was nothing we could have done."""
"""The wench says the same."
She grieves for Renly as you do.
"I promise you, I never grieve for Aerys."
"Brienne's ugly, and pighead stubborn."
"But she lacks the wits to be a liar, and she is loyal past the point of 
sense."
"She swore an oath to bring me to King's Landing, and here I sit."
"This hand I lost ... well, that was 
my doing as much as hers."
"Considering all she did to protect me, I have no doubt that she would have 
fought for Renly, had there been a foe to fight."
"But a shadow? """
Jaime shook his head.
"""Draw your 
sword, Ser Loras."
Show me how you'd fight a shadow.
"I should like to see that."""
Ser Loras made no move to rise.
"""She fled,"" he said."
"""She and Catelyn Stark, they left him in his blood 
and ran."
"Why would they, if it was not their work? """
He stared at the table.
"""Renly gave me the van."
Otherwise it would have been me helping him don his armor.
He often entrusted that task to me.
"We had 
... we had prayed together that night."
I left him with her.
"Ser Parmen and Ser Emmon were guarding the 
tent, and Ser Robar Royce was there as well."
Ser Emmon swore Brienne had.
.
.
although.
.
"""Yes?"""
"Jaime prompted, sensing a doubt."
"""The gorget was cut through."
"One clean stroke, through a steel gorget."
"Renly's armor was the best, the 
finest steel."
How could she do that?
"I tried myself, and it was not possible."
"She's freakish strong for a 
woman, but even the Mountain would have needed a heavy axe."
"And why armor him and then cut his 
throat?"""
He gave Jaime a confused look.
"""If not her, though ... how could it be a shadow?"""
"Page 603

""Ask her."""
Jaime came to a decision.
"""Go to her cell."
Ask your questions and hear her answers.
"If you 
are still convinced that she murdered Lord Renly, I will see that she answers for it."
"The choice will be 
yours."
"Accuse her, or release her."
"All I ask is that you judge her fairly, on your honor as a knight."""
Ser Loras stood.
"""I shall."
"On my honor."""
"""We are done, then."""
The younger man started for the door.
But there he turned back.
"""Renly thought she was absurd."
"A 
woman dressed in man's mail, pretending to be a knight."""
"""If he'd ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace, he would not have complained."""
"""I asked him why he kept her close, if he thought her so grotesque."
"He said that all his other knights 
wanted things of him, castles or honors or riches, but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him."
"When I 
saw him all bloody, with her fled and the three of them unharmed ... if she's innocent, then Robar and 
Emmon..."" He could not seem to say the words."
Jaime had not stopped to consider that aspect of it.
"""I would have done the same, ser,"" The lie came 
easy, but Ser Loras seemed grateful for it."
"When he was gone, the Lord Commander sat alone in the white room, wondering."
"The Knight of 
Flowers had been so mad with grief for Renly that he had cut down two of his own Sworn Brothers, but 
it had never occurred to Jaime to do the same with the five who had failed Joffrey."
"He was my son, my 
secret son ... What am I, if I do not lift the hand I have left to avenge mine own blood and seed?"
"He 
ought to kill Ser Boros at least, just to be rid of him."
He looked at his stump and grimaced.
I must do something about that.
if the late Ser Jacelyn.
"Bywater 
could wear an iron hand, he should have a gold one."
Cersei might like that.
"A golden hand to stroke her 
golden hair, and hold her hard against me."
"His hand could wait, though."
There were other things to tend to first.
There were other debts to pay.
"Chapter 68 
SANSA 
The ladder to the forecastle was steep and splintery, so Sansa accepted a hand up from Lothor Brune."
"Ser Lothor, she had to remind herself; the man had been knighted for his valor in the Battle of the 
Blackwater."
"Though no proper knight would wear those patched brown breeches and scuffed boots, nor 
that cracked and waterstained leather jerkin."
"A square-faced stocky man with a squashed nose and a 
mat of nappy grey hair, Brune spoke seldom."
"He is stronger than he looks, though."
"She could tell by the 
ease with which he lifted her, as if she weighed nothing at all."
"Off the bow of the Merling King stretched a bare and stony strand, windswept, treeless, and uninviting."
"Even so, it made a welcome sight."
They had been a long while clawing their way back on course.
"The 
Page 604

last storm had swept them out of sight of land, and sent such waves crashing over the sides of the galley 
that Sansa had been certain they were all going to drown."
"Two men had been swept overboard, she had 
heard old Oswell saying, and another had fallen from the mast and broken his neck."
She had seldom ventured out on deck herself.
"Her little cabin was dank and cold, but Sansa had been 
sick for most of the voyage ... sick with terror, sick with fever, or seasick ... she could keep nothing 
down, and even sleep came hard."
"Whenever she closed her eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at his collar, 
clawing at the soft skin of his throat, dying with flakes of pie crust on his lips and wine stains on his 
doublet."
"And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he'd made as 
he fought to draw in air."
"Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion 
as well."
"""He did nothing,"" she told Littlefinger once, when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were 
feeling any better."
"""He did not kill Joffrey, true, but the dwarf's hands are far from clean."
"He had a wife before you, did you 
know that?"""
"""He told me."""
"""And did he tell you that when he grew bored with her, he made a gift of her to his father's guardsmen?"
"He might have done the same to you, in time."
"Shed no tears for the Imp, my lady."""
"The wind ran salty fingers through her hair, and Sansa shivered."
"Even this close to shore, the rolling of 
the ship made her tummy queasy."
She desperately needed a bath and a change of clothes.
"I must look as 
haggard as a corpse, and smell of vomit."
"Lord Petyr came up beside her, cheerful as ever."
"""Good morrow."
"The salt air is bracing, don't you 
think?"
"It always sharpens my appetite."""
He put a sympathetic arm about her shoulders.
"""Are you quite 
well?"
"You look so pale."""
"""It's only my tummy."
"The seasickness."""
"""A little wine will be good for that."
"We'll get you a cup, as soon as we're ashore."""
"Petyr pointed to 
where an old flint tower stood outlined against a bleak grey sky, the breakers crashing on the rocks 
beneath it."
"""Cheerful, is it not?"
I fear there's no safe anchorage here.
"We'll put ashore in a boat."""
"""Here?"""
She did not want to go ashore here.
"The Fingers were a dismal place, she'd heard, and there 
was something forlorn and desolate about the little tower."
"""Couldn't I stay on the ship until we make sail 
for White Harbor? """
"""From here the King turns east for Braavos."
"Without us."""
"""But ... my lord, you said... you said we were sailing home."""
"""And there it stands, miserable as it is."
My ancestral home.
"It has no name, I fear."
"A great lord's seat 
ought to have a name, wouldn't you agree?"
"Winterfell, the Eyrie, Riverrun, those are castles."
"Lord of 
Harrenhal now, that has a sweet ring to it, but what was I before?"
"Lord of Sheepshit and Master of the 
Drearfort?"
"It lacks a certain something."""
His grey-green eyes regarded her innocently.
"""You look 
distraught."
"Did you think we were making for Winterfell, sweetling?"
"Winterfell has been taken, burned, 
and sacked."
All those you knew and loved are dead.
"What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen 
are warring amongst themselves."
Even the Wall is under attack.
"Winterfell was the home of your 
Page 605

childhood, Sansa, but you are no longer a child."
"You're a woman grown, and you need to make your 
own home."""
"""But not here,"" she said, dismayed."
"""It looks so."
.
"""."
.
.
small and bleak and mean?
"It's all that, and less."
"The Fingers are a lovely place, if you happen to be 
a stone."
"But have no fear, we shan't 
stay more than a fortnight."
"I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us."""
He smiled.
"""The Lady Lysa 
and I are to be wed."" 
""Wed?"""
Sansa was stunned.
"""You and my aunt?"""
"""The Lord of Harrenhal and the Lady of the Eyrie."""
You said it was my mother you loved.
"But of course Lady Catelyn was dead, so even if she had loved 
Petyr secretly and given him her maidenhood, it made no matter now."
"""So silent, my lady?"""
said Petyr.
"""I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing."
"It is a rare thing 
for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon 
Arryn."""
"""I ..."
"I pray you will have long years together, and many children, and be very happy in one another."""
"It 
had been years since Sansa last saw her mother's sister."
"She will be kind to me for my mother's sake, 
surely."
She's my own blood.
"And the Vale of Arryn was beautiful, all the songs said so."
"Perhaps it would 
not be so terrible to stay here for a time."
Lothor and old Oswell rowed them ashore.
"Sansa huddled in the bow under her cloak with the hood 
drawn up against the wind, wondering what awaited her."
"Servants emerged from the tower to meet them; 
a thin old woman and a fat middle-aged one, two ancient white-haired men, and a girl of two or three 
with a sty on one eye."
When they recognized Lord Petyr they knelt on the rocks.
"""My household,"" he 
said."
"""I don't know the child."
"Another of Kella's bastards, I suppose."
"She pops one out every few years."""
"The two old men waded out up to their thighs to lift Sansa from the boat so she would not get her skirts 
wet."
"Oswell and Lothor splashed their way ashore, as did Littlefinger himself."
"He gave the old woman a 
kiss on the cheek and grinned at the younger one."
"""Who fathered this one, Kella? """
The fat woman laughed.
"""I can't rightly say, m'lord."
"I'm not one for telling them no."""
"""And all the local lads are grateful, I am quite sure."""
"""It is good to have you home, my lord,"" said one old man."
"He looked to be at least eighty, but he wore a 
studded brigantine and a longsword at his side."
"""How long will you be in residence?"""
"""As short a time as possible, Bryen, have no fear."
"Is the place habitable just now, would you say?"""
"""If we knew you was coming we would have laid down fresh rushes, m'lord,"" said the crone."
"""There's a 
dung fire burning."""
"""Nothing says home like the smell of burning dung."""
Petyr turned to Sansa.
"""Grisel was my wet nurse, 
but she keeps my castle now."
"Umfred's my steward, and Bryen - didn't I name you captain of the guard 
Page 606

the last time 1 was here?"""
"""You did, my lord."
"You said you'd be getting some more men too, but you never did."
"Me and the dogs 
stand all the watches."""
"""And very well, I'm sure."
"No one has made off with any of my rocks or sheep pellets, I see that plainly."""
Petyr gestured toward the fat woman.
"""Kella minds my vast herds."
"How many sheep do I have at 
present, Kella?"""
She had to think a moment.
"""Three and twenty, m'lord."
"There was nine and twenty, but Bryen's dogs 
killed one and we butchered some others and salted down the meat."""
"""Ah, cold salt mutton."
I must be home.
"When I break my fast on gulls' eggs and seaweed soup, I'll be 
certain of it."""
"""If you like, m'lord,"" said the old woman Grisel."
Lord Petyr made a face.
"""Come, let's see if my hall is as dreary as I recall."""
"He led them up the strand 
over rocks slick with rotting seaweed."
"A handful of sheep were wandering about the base of the flint 
tower, grazing on the thin grass that grew between the sheepfold and thatched stable."
"Sansa had to step 
carefully; there were pellets everywhere."
"Within, the tower seemed even smaller."
"An open stone stair wound round the inside wall, from 
undercroft to roof."
Each floor was but a single room.
"The servants lived and slept in the kitchen at ground 
level, sharing the space with a huge brindled mastiff and a half-dozen sheepdogs."
"Above that was a 
modest hall, and higher still the bedchamber."
"There were no windows, but arrowslits were embedded in 
the outer wall at intervals along the curve of the stair."
"Above the hearth hung a broken longsword and a 
battered oaken shield, its paint cracked and flaking."
"The device painted on the shield was one Sansa did not know; a grey stone head with fiery eyes, upon a 
light green field."
"""My grandfather's shield,"" Petyr explained when he saw her gazing at it."
"""His own father 
was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray, so my grandfather 
took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted."""
"""It's very fierce,"" said Sansa."
"""Rather too fierce, for an amiable fellow like me,"" said Petyr."
"""I much prefer my mockingbird."""
Oswell made two more trips out to the Merling King to offload provisions.
"Among the loads he brought 
ashore were several casks of wine."
"Petyr poured Sansa a cup, as promised."
"""Here, my lady, that should 
help your tummy, I would hope."""
"Having solid ground beneath her feet had helped already, but Sansa dutifully lifted the goblet with both 
hands and took a sip."
"The wine was very fine; an Arbor vintage, she thought."
"it tasted of oak and fruit 
and hot summer nights, the flavors blossoming in her mouth like flowers 
opening to the sun."
She only prayed that she could keep it down.
"Lord Petyr was being so kind, she did 
not want to spoil it all by retching on him."
"He was studying her over his own goblet, his bright grey-green eyes full of ... was it amusement?"
"Or 
something else?"
Sansa was not certain.
"""Grisel,"" he called to the old woman, ""bring some food up."
"Page 607

Nothing too heavy, my lady has a tender tummy."
"Some fruit might serve, perhaps."
"Oswell's brought some 
oranges and pomegranates from the King."""
"""Yes, m'lord."""
"""Might I have a hot bath as well?"""
asked Sansa.
"""I'll have Kella draw some water, m'lady."""
"Sansa took another sip of wine and tried to think of some polite conversation, but Lord Petyr saved her 
the effort."
"When Grisel and the other servants had gone, he said, ""Lysa will not come alone."
"Before she 
arrives, we must be clear on who you are."""
"""Who I ..."
"I don't understand."""
"""Varys has informers everywhere."
"If Sansa Stark should be seen in the Vale, the eunuch will know within 
a moon's turn, and that would create unfortunate ... complications."
it is not safe to be a Stark just now.
"So we shall tell Lysa's people that you are my natural daughter."""
"""Natural?"""
Sansa was aghast.
"""You mean, a bastard?"""
"""Well, you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter."
"I've never taken a wife, that's well known."
"What 
should you be called?"""
"""I ..."
"I could call myself after my mother..."" 
""Catelyn?"
"A bit too obvious ... but after my mother, that would serve."
Alayne.
"Do you like it?"""
"""Alayne is pretty."""
Sansa hoped she would remember.
"""But couldn't I be the trueborn daughter of some 
knight in your service?"
"Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle, and."
.
"."""
"""I have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne."
"Such a tale would draw unwanted questions as a corpse 
draws crows."
"It is rude to pry into the origins of a man's natural children, however."""
He cocked his head.
"""So, who are you?"""
"""Alayne ... Stone, would it be?"""
"When he nodded, she said, ""But who is my mother?"""
"""Kella?"""
"""Please no,"" she said, mortified."
"""I was teasing."
"Your mother was a gentlewoman of Braavos, daughter of a merchant prince."
"We met in 
Gulltown when I had charge of the port."
"She died giving you birth, and entrusted you to the Faith."
"I have 
some devotional books you can look over."
Learn to quote from them.
"Nothing discourages unwanted 
questions as much as a flow of pious bleating."
"In any case, at your flowering you decided you did not 
wish to be a septa 
and wrote to me."
"That was the first I knew of your existence."""
He fingered his beard.
"""Do you think you 
can remember all that?"""
"""I hope."
"It will be like playing a game, won't it?"""
"Page 608

""Are you fond of games, Alayne?"""
The new name would take some getting used to.
"""Games?"
I ...
"I suppose it would depend..."" 
Grisel reappeared before he could say more, balancing a large platter."
She set it down between them.
"There were apples and pears and pomegranates, some sad-looking grapes, a huge blood orange."
"The 
old woman had brought a round of bread as well, and a crock of butter."
"Petyr cut a pomegranate in two 
with his dagger, offering half to Sansa."
"""You should try and eat, my lady."""
"""Thank you, my lord."""
"Pomegranate seeds were so messy; Sansa chose a pear instead, and took a small 
delicate bite."
It was very ripe.
The juice ran down her chin.
Lord Petyr loosened a seed with the point of his dagger.
"""You must miss your father terribly, I know."
"Lord Eddard was a brave man, honest and loyal ... but quite a hopeless player."""
"He brought the seed to 
his mouth with the knife."
"""In King's Landing, there are two sorts of people."
"The players and the pieces."""
"""And I was a piece?"""
She dreaded the answer.
"""Yes, but don't let that trouble you."
You're still half a child.
"Every man's a piece to start with, and every 
maid as well."
"Even some who think they are players."""
He ate another seed.
"""Cersei, for one."
"She thinks 
herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable."
"Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches."
"Only 
the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her."
I pity her then.
"She wants power, but has no 
notion what to do with it when she gets it."
"Everyone wants something, Alayne."
"And when you know what 
a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him."""
"""As you moved Ser Dontos to poison Joffrey?"""
"It had to have been Dontos, she had concluded."
Littlefinger laughed.
"""Ser Dontos the Red was a skin of wine with legs."
"He could never have been trusted 
with a task of such enormity."
He would have bungled it or betrayed me.
"No, all Dontos had to do was 
lead you from the castle ."
.
.
"and make certain you wore your silver hair net."""
The black amethysts.
"""But... if not Dontos, who?"
Do you have other ...
"pieces?"""
"""You could turn King's Landing upside down and not find a single man with a mockingbird sewn over his 
heart, but that does not mean I am friendless."""
Petyr went to the steps.
"""Oswell, come up here and let the 
Lady Sansa have a look at you."""
"The old man appeared a few moments later, grinning and bowing."
Sansa eyed him uncertainly.
"""What am 
I supposed to see?"""
"""Do you know him?"""
asked Petyr.
"""No."""
"""Look closer."""
"She studied the old man's lined windburnt face, hook nose, white hair, and huge knuckly hands."
"There 
was something familiar about him, yet Sansa had to shake her head."
"""I don't."
"I never saw Oswell before I 
got into his boat, I'm certain."""
"Page 609

Oswell grinned, showing a mouth of crooked teeth."
"""No, but m'lady might of met my three sons."""
"It was the ""three sons,"" and that smile too."
"""Kettleblack!"""
Sansa's eyes went wide.
"""You're a 
Kettleblack!"""
"""Aye, m'lady, as it please you."""
"""She's beside herself with joy."""
"Lord Petyr dismissed him with a wave, and returned to the pomegranate 
again as Oswell shuffled down the steps."
"""Tell me, Alayne - which is more dangerous, the dagger 
brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one pressed to your back by someone you never even see?"""
"""The hidden dagger."""
"""There's a clever girl."""
"He smiled, his thin lips bright red from the pomegranate seeds."
"""When the Imp 
sent off her guards, the queen had Ser Lancel hire sellswords for her."
"Lancel found her the Kettleblacks, 
which delighted your little lord husband, since the lads were in his pay through his man Bronn."""
"He 
chuckled."
"""But it was me who told Oswell to get his sons to King's Landing when I learned that Bronn 
was looking for swords."
"Three hidden daggers, Alayne, now perfectly placed."""
"""So one of the Kettleblacks put the poison in Joff 's cup?"""
"Ser Osmund had been near the king all night, 
she remembered."
"""Did I say that?"""
Lord Petyr cut the blood orange in two with his dagger and offered half to Sansa.
"""The 
lads are far too treacherous to be part of any such scheme ... and Osmund has become especially 
unreliable since he joined the Kingsguard."
"That white cloak does things to a man, I find."
"Even a man like 
him."""
"He tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into his mouth."
"""I love 
the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,"" he complained, wiping his hands."
"""Clean hands, Sansa."
"Whatever 
you do, make certain your hands are clean."""
Sansa spooned up some juice from her own orange.
"""But if it wasn't the Kettleblacks and it wasn't Ser 
Dontos ... you weren't even in the city, and it couldn't have been Tyrion ."
.
.
"""No more guesses, sweetling?"""
She shook her head.
"""I don't ."
.
.
Petyr smiled.
"""I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net 
was crooked and straightened it for you."""
Sansa raised a hand to her mouth.
"""You cannot mean ... she wanted to take me to Highgarden, to marry 
me to her grandson..."" 
""Gentle, pious, good-hearted Willas Tyrell."
"Be grateful you were spared, he would have bored you 
spitless."
"The old woman is not boring, though, I'll grant her that."
"A fearsome old harridan, and not near as 
frail as she pretends."
"When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery's hand, she let her lord son 
bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey's nature."
"I praised him to the skies, to be sure.. ."
whilst my men spread disturbing tales amongst Lord Tyrell's servants.
That is how the game is played.
"""I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white."
"Not that I suggested it, that would have been 
too crude."
"But men in my party supplied grisly tales about how the mob had killed Ser Preston Greenfield 
and raped the Lady Lollys, and slipped a few silvers to Lord Tyrell's army of singers to sing of Ryam 
Page 610

Redwyne, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight."
"A harp can be as 
dangerous as a sword, in the right hands."
"""Mace Tyrell actually thought it was his own idea to make Ser Loras's inclusion in the Kingsguard part of 
the marriage contract."
Who better to protect his daughter than her splendid knightly brother?
"And it 
relieved him of the difficult task of trying to find lands and a bride for a third son, never easy, and doubly 
difficult in Ser Loras's case."
"""Be that as it may."
"Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm her precious darling granddaughter, but 
unlike her son she also realized that under all his flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as 
Jaime Lannister."
"Toss Joffrey, Margaery, and Loras in a pot, and you've got the makings for kingslayer 
stew."
The old woman understood something else as well.
"Her son was determined to make Margaery a 
queen, and for that he needed a king ... but he did not need /offrey."
"We shall have another wedding soon, 
wait and see."
Margaery will marry Tommen.
"She'll keep her queenly crown and her maidenhead, neither 
of which she especially wants, but what does that matter?"
"The great western alliance will be preserved ... 
for a time, at least."""
Margaery and Tommen.
Sansa did not know what to say.
"She had liked Margaery Tyrell, and her small 
sharp grandmother as well."
"She thought wistfully of Highgarden with its courtyards and musicians, and the 
pleasure barges on the Mander; a far cry from this bleak shore."
At least I am safe here.
"loffrey is dead, 
he cannot hurt me anymore, and I am only a bastard girl now Alayne Stone has no husband and no claim."
And her aunt would soon be here as well.
"The long nightmare of King's Landing was behind her, and her 
mockery of a marriage as well."
"She could make herself a new home here, just as Petyr said."
It was eight long days until Lysa Arryn arrived.
"On five of them it 
rained, while Sansa sat bored and restless by the fire, beside the old blind dog."
"He was too sick and 
toothless to walk guard with Bryen anymore, and mostly all he did was sleep, but when she patted him he 
whined and licked her hand, and after that they were fast friends."
"When the rains let up, Petyr walked 
with her around his holdings, which took less than half a day."
"He owned a lot of rocks, just as he had 
said."
"There was one place where the tide came jetting up out of a blowhole to shoot thirty feet into the 
air, and another where someone had chiseled the seven-pointed star of the new gods upon a boulder."
"Petyr said that marked one of the places the Andals had landed, when they came across the sea to wrest 
the Vale from the First Men."
Farther inland a dozen families lived in huts of piled stone beside a peat bog.
"""Mine own smallfolk,"" 
Petyr said, though only the oldest seemed to know him."
"There was a hermit's cave on his land as well, 
but no hermit."
"""He's dead now, but when I was a boy my father took me to see him."
"The man had not 
washed in forty years, so you can imagine how he smelled, but supposedly he had the gift of prophecy."
"He groped me a bit and said I would be a great man, and for that my father gave him a skin of wine."""
Petyr snorted.
"""I would have told him the same thing for half a cup."""
"Finally, on a grey windy afternoon, Bryen came running back to the tower with his dogs barking at his 
heels, to announce that riders were approaching from the southwest."
"""Lysa,"" Lord Petyr said."
"""Come, 
Alayne, let us greet her."""
They put on their cloaks and waited outside.
"The riders numbered no more than a score; a very modest 
escort, for the Lady of the Eyrie."
"Three maids rode with her, and a dozen household knights in mail and 
plate."
"She brought a septon as well, and a handsome singer with a wisp of a mustache and long sandy 
curls."
"Page 611

Could that be my aunt?"
"Lady Lysa was two years younger than Mother, but this woman looked ten 
years older."
"Thick auburn tresses fell down past her waist, but beneath the costly velvet gown and 
jeweled bodice her body sagged and bulged."
"Her face was pink and painted, her breasts heavy, her 
limbs thick."
"She was taller than Littlefinger, and heavier; nor did she show any grace in the clumsy way 
she climbed down off her horse."
Petyr knelt to kiss her fingers.
"""The king's small council commanded me to woo and win you, my lady."
"Do you think you might have me for your lord and husband?"""
Lady Lysa pooched her lips and pulled him up to plant a kiss upon his cheek.
"""Oh, mayhaps I could be 
persuaded."""
She giggled.
"""Have you brought gifts to melt my heart?"""
"""The king's peace."""
"""Oh, poo to the peace, what else have you brought me?"""
"""My daughter."""
Littlefinger beckoned Sansa forward with a hand.
"""My lady, allow me to present you 
Alayne Stone."""
Lysa Arryn did not seem greatly pleased to see her.
"Sansa did a deep curtsy, her head bowed."
"""A 
bastard?"""
she heard her aunt say.
"""Petyr, have you been wicked?"
"Who was her mother?"""
"""The wench is dead."
"I'd hoped to take Alayne to the Eyrie."""
"""What am I to do with her there?"""
"""I have a few notions,"" said Lord Petyr."
"""But just now I am more interested in what I might do with you, 
my lady."""
"All the sternness melted off her aunt's round pink face, and for a moment Sansa thought Lysa Arryn was 
about to cry."
"""Sweet Petyr, I've missed you so, you don't know, you can't know."
"Yohn Royce has been 
stirring up all sorts of trouble, demanding that I call my banners and go to war."
"And the others all swarm 
around me, Hunter and Corbray and that dreadful Nestor Royce, all wanting to wed me and take my son 
to ward, but none of them truly love me."
"Only you, Petyr."
"I've dreamed of you so long."""
"""And I of you, my lady."""
He slid an arm around behind her and kissed her on the neck.
"""How soon can 
we be wed?"""
"""Now,"" said Lady Lysa, sighing."
"""I've brought my own septon, and a singer, and mead for the wedding 
feast."""
"""Here?"""
That did not please him.
"""I'd sooner wed you at the Eyrie, with your whole court in attendance."""
"""Poo to my court."
"I have waited so long, I could not bear to wait another moment."""
"She put her arms 
around him."
"""I want to share your bed tonight, my sweet."
"I want us to make another child, a brother for 
Robert or a sweet little daughter."""
"""I dream of that as well, sweetling."
"Yet there is much to be gained from a great public wedding, with all 
the Vale - "" 
""No."""
She stamped a foot.
"""I want you now, this very night."
"And I must warn you, after all these years of 
Page 612

silence and whisperings, I mean to scream when you love me."
"I am going to scream so loud they'll hear 
me in the Eyrie!"""
"""Perhaps I could bed you now, and wed you later?"""
The Lady Lysa giggled like a girl.
"""Oh, Petyr Baelish, you are so wicked."
"No, I say no, I am the Lady of 
the Eyrie, and I command you to wed me this very moment!"""
Petyr gave a shrug.
"""As my lady commands, then."
"I am helpless before you, as ever."""
"They said their vows within the hour, standing beneath a sky-blue canopy as the sun sank in the west."
"Afterward trestle tables were set up beneath the small flint tower, and they feasted on quail, venison, and 
roast boar, washing it down with a fine light mead."
Torches were lit as dusk crept in.
"Lysa's singer 
played ""The Vow Unspoken"" and ""Seasons of My Love"" and ""Two Hearts That Beat as One."""
"Several 
younger knights even asked Sansa to dance."
"Her aunt danced as well, her skirts whirling when Petyr 
spun her in his arms."
Mead and marriage had taken years off Lady Lysa.
"She laughed at everything so 
long as she held her husband's hand, and her eyes seemed to glow whenever she looked at him."
"When it was time for the bedding, her knights carried her up to the tower, stripping her as they went and 
shouting bawdy jests."
"Tyrion spared me that, Sansa remembered."
"It would not have been so bad being 
undressed for a man she loved, by friends who loved them both."
"By Joffrey, though ... She shuddered."
"Her aunt had brought only three ladies with her, so they pressed Sansa to help them undress Lord Petyr 
and march him up to his marriage bed."
"He submitted with good grace and a wicked tongue, giving as 
good as he got."
"By the time they had gotten him into the tower and out of his clothes, the other women 
were flushed, with laces unlaced, kirtles crooked, and skirts in disarray."
"But Littlefinger only smiled at 
Sansa as they marched him up to the bedchamber where his lady wife was waiting."
"Lady Lysa and Lord Petyr had the third-story bedchamber to themselves, but the tower was small ... 
and true to her word, her aunt screamed."
"It had begun to rain outside, driving the feasters into the hall 
one floor below, so they heard most every word."
"""Petyr,"" her aunt moaned."
"""Oh, Petyr, Petyr, sweet 
Petyr, oh oh oh."
"There, Petyr, there."
"That's where you belong."""
"Lady Lysa's singer launched into a 
bawdy version of ""Milady's Supper,"" but even his singing and playing could not drown out Lysa's cries."
"""Make me a baby, Petyr,"" she screamed, ""make me another sweet little baby."
"Oh, Petyr, my precious, 
my precious, PEEEEEETYR!"""
"Her last shriek was so loud that it set the dogs to barking, and two of her 
aunt's ladies could scarce contain their mirth."
Sansa went down the steps and out into the night.
"A light rain was falling on the remains of the feast, but 
the air smelled fresh and clean."
The memory of her own wedding night with Tyrion was much with her.
"In 
the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers, he had said."
I could be good to you.
"But that was only another 
Lannister lie."
"A dog can smell a lie, you know, the Hound had told her once."
"She could almost hear the 
rough rasp of his voice."
"Look around you, and take a good whiff."
"They're all liars here, and every one 
better than you."
She wondered what had become of Sandor Clegane.
"Did he know that they'd killed 
Joffrey?"
Would he care?
He had been the prince's sworn shield for years.
She stayed outside for a long time.
"When at last she sought her own bed, wet and chilled, only the dim 
glow of a peat fire lit the darkened hall."
There was no sound from above.
"The young singer sat in a 
corner, 
playing a slow song to himself."
"One of her aunt's maids was kissing a knight in Lord Petyr's chair, their 
Page 613

hands busy beneath each other's clothing."
"Several men had drunk themselves to sleep, and one was in the 
privy, being noisily sick."
"Sansa found Bryen's old blind dog in her little alcove beneath the steps, and lay 
down next to him."
He woke and licked her face.
"""You sad old hound,"" she said, ruffling his fur."
"""Alayne."""
Her aunt's singer stood over her.
"""Sweet Alayne."
I am Marillion.
"I saw you come in from the 
rain."
The night is chill and wet.
"Let me warm you."""
"The old dog raised his head and growled, but the singer gave him a cuff and sent him slinking off, 
whimpering."
"""Marillion?"""
"she said, uncertain."
"""You are ... kind to think of me, but ... pray forgive me."
"I am very tired."""
"""And very beautiful."
All night I have been making songs for you in my head.
"A lay for your eyes, a ballad 
for your lips, a duet to your breasts."
"I will not sing them, though."
"They were poor things, unworthy of 
such beauty."""
He sat on her bed and put his hand on her leg.
"""Let me sing to you with my body instead."""
She caught a whiff of his breath.
"""You're drunk."""
"""I never get drunk."
Mead only makes me merry.
"I am on fire."""
His hand slipped up to her thigh.
"""And 
you as well."""
"""Unhand me."
"You forget yourself."""
"""Mercy."
I have been singing love songs for hours.
My blood is stirred.
"And yours, I know ... there's no 
wench half so lusty as one bastard born."
"Are you wet for me?"""
"""I'm a maiden,"" she protested."
"""Truly?"
"Oh, Alayne, Alayne, my fair maid, give me the gift of your innocence."
"You will thank the gods 
you did."
"I'll have you singing louder than the Lady Lysa."""
"Sansa jerked away from him, frightened."
"""If you don't leave me, my au - my father will hang you."
"Lord 
Petyr."""
"""Littlefinger?"""
He chuckled.
"""Lady Lysa loves me well, and I am Lord Robert's favorite."
"If your father 
offends me, I will destroy him with a verse."""
"He put a hand on her breast, and squeezed."
"""Let's get you 
out of these wet clothes."
"You wouldn't want them ripped, I know."
"Come, sweet lady, heed your heart - "" 
Sansa heard the soft sound of steel on leather."
"""Singer,"" a rough voice said, ""best go, if you want to sing 
again."""
"The light was dim, but she saw a faint glimmer of a blade."
The singer saw it too.
"""Find your own wench - "" The knife flashed, and he cried out."
"""You cut me!"""
"""I'll do worse, if you don't go."""
"And quick as that, Marillion was gone."
"The other remained, looming 
over Sansa in the darkness."
"""Lord Petyr said watch out for you."""
"It was Lothor Brune's voice, she 
realized."
"Not the Hound's, no, how could it be?"
"Of course it had to be Lothor ... 
That night Sansa scarcely slept at all, but tossed and turned just as she had aboard the Merling King."
"Page 614

She dreamt of Joffrey dying, but as he clawed at his throat and the blood ran down across his fingers she 
saw with horror that it was her brother Robb."
"And she dreamed of her wedding night too, of Tyrion's 
eyes devouring her as she undressed."
"Only then he was bigger than Tyrion had any right to be, and when 
he climbed into the bed his face was scarred only on one side."
"""I'll have a song from you,"" he rasped, and 
Sansa woke and found the old blind dog beside her once again."
"""I wish that you were Lady,"" she said."
"Come the morning, Grisel climbed up to the bedchamber to serve the lord and lady a tray of morning 
bread, with butter, honey, fruit, and cream."
She returned to say that Alayne was wanted.
"Sansa was still 
drowsy from sleep."
it took her a moment to remember that she was Alayne.
"Lady Lysa was still abed, but Lord Petyr was up and dressed."
"""Your aunt wishes to speak with you,"" he 
told Sansa, as he pulled on a boot."
"""I've told her who you are."""
Gods be good.
"""I ..."
"I thank you, my lord."""
Petyr yanked on the other boot.
"""I've had about as much home as I can stomach."
"We'll leave for the 
Eyrie this afternoon."""
"He kissed his lady wife and licked a smear of honey off her lips, then headed down 
the steps."
Sansa stood by the foot of the bed while her aunt ate a pear and studied her.
"""I see it now,"" the Lady 
Lysa said, as she set the core aside."
"""You look so much like Catelyn."""
"""It's kind of you to say so."""
"""It was not meant as flattery."
"if truth be told, you look too much like Catelyn."
Something must be done.
"We shall darken your hair before we bring you back to the Eyrie, I think."""
Darken my hair?
"""If it please you, Aunt Lysa."""
"""You must not call me that."
No word of your presence here must be allowed to reach King's Landing.
"I 
do not mean to have my son endangered."""
She nibbled the comer of a honeycomb.
"""I have kept the Vale 
out of this war."
"Our harvest has been plentiful, the mountains protect us, and the Eyrie is impregnable."
"Even so, it would not do to draw Lord Tywin's wroth down upon us."""
"Lysa set the comb down and 
licked honey from her fingers."
"""You were wed to Tyrion Lannister, Petyr says."
"That vile dwarf."""
"""They made me marry him."
"I never wanted it."""
",'No more than I did,"" her aunt said."
"""Jon Arryn was no dwarf, but he was old."
"You may not think so to 
see me now, but on the day we wed I 
was so lovely I put your mother to shame."
"But all Jon desired was my father's swords, to aid his darling 
boys."
"I should have refused him, but he was such an old man, how long could he live?"
"Half his teeth were 
gone, and his breath smelled like bad cheese."
I cannot abide a man with foul breath.
"Petyr's breath is 
always fresh ... he was the first man I ever kissed, you know."
"My father said he was too lowborn, but I 
knew how high he'd rise."
"Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the 
incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was and gave him other appointments, even brought 
him to King's Landing to be master of coin."
"That was hard, to see him every day and still be wed to that 
old cold man."
"Jon did his duty in the bedchamber, but he could no more give me pleasure than he could 
give me children."
His seed was old and weak.
"All my babies died but Robert, three girls and two boys."
"All my sweet little babies dead, and that old man just went on and on with his stinking breath."
"So you 
see, I have suffered too."""
Lady Lysa sniffed.
"""You do know that your poor mother is dead?"""
"Page 615

""Tyrion told me,"" said Sansa."
"""He said the Freys murdered her at The Twins, with Robb."""
Tears welled suddenly in Lady Lysa's eyes.
"""We are women alone now, you and I."
"Are you afraid, 
child?"
Be brave.
I would never turn away Cat's daughter.
"We are bound by blood."""
"She beckoned 
Sansa closer."
"""You may come kiss my cheek, Alayne."""
Dutifully she approached and knelt beside the bed.
"Her aunt was drenched in sweet scent, though under 
that was a sour milky smell."
Her cheek tasted of paint and powder.
"As Sansa stepped back, Lady Lysa caught her wrist."
"""Now tell me,"" she said sharply."
"""Are you with 
child?"
"The truth now, I will know if you lie."""
"""No,"" she said, startled by the question."
"""You are a woman flowered, are you not?"""
"""Yes."""
Sansa knew the truth of her flowering could not be long hidden in the Eyrie.
"""Tyrion didn't ... he 
never..."" She could feel the blush creeping up her cheeks."
"""I am still a maid."""
"""Was the dwarf incapable?"""
"""No."
"He was only ... he was..."" Kind?"
"She could not say that, not here, not to this aunt who hated him 
so."
"""He ... he had whores, my lady."
"He told me so."""
"""Whores."""
Lysa released her wrist.
"""Of course he did."
"What woman would bed such a creature, but for 
gold?"
"I should have killed the Imp when he was in my power, but he tricked me."
"He is full of low 
cunning, that one."
His sellsword slew my good Ser Vardis Egen.
"Catelyn should not have brought him 
here, I told her that."
She made off with our uncle too.
That was wrong of her.
"The Blackfish was my 
Knight of the Gate, 
and since he left us the mountain clans are growing very bold."
"Petyr will soon set all that to rights, 
though."
"I shall make him Lord Protector of the Vale."""
"Her aunt smiled for the first time, almost warmly."
"""He may not look as tall or strong as some, but he is worth more than all of them."
"Trust in him and do as 
he says."""
"""I shall, Aunt ... my lady."""
Lady Lysa seemed pleased by that.
"""I knew that boy Joffrey."
"He used to call my Robert cruel names, 
and once he slapped him with a wooden sword."
"A man will tell you poison is dishonorable, but a 
woman's honor is different."
"The Mother shaped us to protect our children, and our only dishonor is in 
failure."
"You'll know that, when you have a child."""
"""A child?"""
"said Sansa, uncertainly."
Lysa waved a hand negligently.
"""Not for many years."
You are too young to be a mother.
"One day you 
shall want children, though."
"just as you will want to marry."""
"""I ..."
"I am married, my lady."""
"""Yes, but soon a widow."
Be glad the Imp preferred his whores.
"It would not be fitting for my son to take 
Page 616

that dwarfs leavings, but as he never touched you ... How would you like to marry your cousin, the Lord 
Robert? """
The thought made Sansa weary.
"All she knew of Robert Arryn was that he was a little boy, and sickly."
"It 
is not me she wants her son to marry, it is my claim."
No one will ever marry me for love.
"But lying came 
easy to her now."
"""I ... can scarcely wait to meet him, my lady."
"But he is still a child, is he not?"""
"""He is eight."
And not robust.
"But such a good boy, so bright and clever."
"He will be a great man, Alayne."
"The seed is strong, my lord husband said before he died."
His last words.
"The gods sometimes let us 
glimpse the future as we lay dying."
"I see no reason why you should not be wed as soon as we know that 
your Lannister husband is dead."
"A secret wedding, to be sure."
"The Lord of the Eyrie could scarcely be 
thought to have married a bastard, that would not be fitting."
"The ravens should bring us the word from 
King's Landing once the Imp's head rolls."
"You and Robert can be wed the next day, won't that be 
joyous?"
it will be good for him to have a little companion.
"He played with Vardis Egen's boy when we 
first returned to the Eyrie, and my steward's sons as well, but they were much too rough and I had no 
choice but to send them away."
"Do you read well, Alayne? """
"""Septa Mordane was good enough to say so."""
"'Robert has weak eyes, but he loves to be read to,"" Lady Lysa confided."
"""He likes stories about animals 
the best."
Do you know the little song about the chicken who dressed as a fox?
"I sing him that all the time, 
he never grows tired of it."
"And he likes to play hopfrog and spin-the-sword 
and come-into-my-castle, but you must always let him win."
"That's only proper, don't you think?"
"He is 
the Lord of the Eyrie, after all, you must never forget that."
"You are well born, and the Starks of Winterfell 
were always proud, but Winterfell has fallen and you are really just a beggar now, so put that pride aside."
"Gratitude will better become you, in your present circumstances."
"Yes, and obedience."
"My son will have a 
grateful and obedient wife."""
"Chapter 69 
JON 
Day and night the axes rang."
Jon could not remember the last time he had slept.
"When he closed his eyes he dreamed of fighting; 
when he woke he fought."
"Even in the King's Tower he could hear the ceaseless thunk of bronze and flint 
and stolen steel biting into wood, and it was louder when he tried to rest in the warming shed atop the 
Wall."
"Mance had sledgehammers at work as well, and long saws with teeth of bone and flint."
"Once, as 
he was drifting off into an exhausted sleep, there came a great cracking from the haunted forest, and a 
sentinel tree came crashing down in a cloud of dirt and needles."
"He was awake when Owen came to him, lying restless under a pile of furs on the floor of the warming 
shed."
"""Lord Snow,"" said Owen, shaking his shoulder, ""the dawn."""
"He gave Jon a hand to help pull him 
back onto his feet."
"Others were waking as well, jostling one another as they pulled on their boots and 
buckled their swordbelts in the close confines of the shed."
No one spoke.
"They were all too tired for 
talk."
Few of them ever left the Wall these days.
it took too long to ride up and down in the cage.
"Castle 
Page 617

Black had been abandoned to Maester Aemon, Ser Wynton Stout, and a few others too old or ill to 
fight."
"""I had a dream that the king had come,"" Owen said happily."
"""Maester Aemon sent a raven, and King 
Robert came with all his strength."
"I dreamed I saw his golden banners."""
Jon made himself smile.
"""That would be a welcome sight to see, Owen."""
"Ignoring the twinge of pain in 
his leg, he swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders, gathered up his crutch, and went out onto the 
Wall to face another day."
A gust of wind sent icy tendrils wending through his long brown hair.
"Half a mile north, the wildling 
encampments were stirring, their campfires sending up smoky fingers to scratch against the pale dawn 
sky."
"Along the edge of the forest they had raised their tents of hide and fur, even a crude longhall of logs 
and woven branches; there were horselines to the east, mammoths to the west, and men everywhere, 
sharpening their swords, putting points on crude spears, donning makeshift armor of hide and horn and 
bone."
"For every man that he could see, Jon knew there were a score unseen in the wood."
"The brush 
gave them some shelter from the elements and hid them from the eyes of the hated crows."
"Already their archers were stealing forward, pushing their rolling mantlets."
"""Here come our breakfast 
arrows,"" Pyp announced cheerfully, as he did every morning."
"It's good that he can make a jape of it, Jon 
thought."
Someone has to.
"Three days ago, one of those breakfast arrows had caught Red Alyn of the 
Rosewood in the leg."
"You could still see his body at the foot of the Wall, if you cared to lean out far 
enough."
"Jon had to think that it was better for them to smile at Pyp's jest than to brood over Alyn's 
corpse."
"The mantlets were slanting wooden shields, wide enough for five of the free folk to hide behind."
"The 
archers pushed them close, then knelt behind them to loose their arrows through slits in the wood."
"The 
first time the wildlings rolled them out, Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half -dozen ablaze, but 
after that Mance started covering them with raw hides."
"All the fire arrows in the world couldn't make 
them catch now."
"The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect 
the most arrows before they were done."
"Dolorous Edd was leading with four, but Othell Yarwyck, 
Tumberjon, and Watt of Long Lake had three apiece."
"It was Pyp who'd started naming the scarecrows 
after their missing brothers, too."
"""It makes it seem as if there's more of us,"" he said."
"""More of us with arrows in our bellies,"" Grenn complained, but the custom did seem to give his brothers 
heart, so Jon let the names stand and the wagering continue."
On the edge of the Wall an ornate brass Myrish eye stood on three spindly legs.
"Maester Aemon had 
once used it to peer at the stars, before his own eyes had failed him."
"Jon swung the tube down to have a 
look at the foe."
"Even at this distance there was no mistaking Mance Rayder's huge white tent, sewn 
together from the pelts of snow bears."
"The Myrish lenses brought the wildlings close enough for him to 
make out faces."
"Of Mance himself he saw no sign this morning, but his woman Dalla was outside tending 
the fire, while her sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent."
"Dalla looked so big it was a wonder she 
could move."
"The child must be coming very soon, Jon thought."
"He swiveled the eye east and searched 
amongst the tents and trees till he found the turtle."
That will be coming very soon as well.
"The wildlings 
had skinned one of the dead mammoths during the night, and they were lashing the raw bloody hide over 
the turtle's roof, one more layer on top of the sheepskins and pelts."
"The turtle had a rounded top and 
eight huge wheels, and under the hides was a stout wooden frame."
"When the wildlings had begun 
knocking it together, Satin thought they were building a ship."
Not far wrong.
"The turtle was a hull turned 
upside down and opened fore and aft; a longhall on wheels."
"Page 618

""It's done, isn't it?"""
asked Grenn.
"""Near enough."""
Jon shoved away the eye.
"""It will come today, most like."
"Did you fill the barrels?"""
"""Every one."
"They froze hard during the night, Pyp checked."""
"Grenn had changed a great deal from the big, clumsy, red-necked boy Jon had first befriended."
"He had 
grown half a foot, his chest and shoulders had thickened, and he had not cut his hair nor trimmed his 
beard since the Fist of the First Men."
"It made him look as huge and shaggy as an aurochs, the mocking 
name that Ser Alliser Thorne had hung on him during training."
"He looked weary now, though."
"When Jon 
said as much, he nodded."
"""I heard their axes all night."
"Couldn't sleep for all the chopping."""
"""Then go sleep now."""
"""I don't need - "" 
""You do."
I want you rested.
"Go on, I'm not going to let you sleep through the fight."""
"He made himself 
smile."
"""You're the only one who can move those bloody barrels."""
"Grenn went off muttering, and Jon returned to the far eye, searching the wildling camp."
"From time to 
time an arrow would sail past overhead, but he had learned to ignore those."
"The range was long and the 
angle was bad, the chances of being hit were small."
"He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp, 
but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle."
"The sons were struggling with 
the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders."
"Elsewhere he 
found the wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging 
his heels."
"When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening, he knew it 
would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning."
"The sight of Mance's turtle had robbed 
Jon of his appetite."
"Their oil was all but gone, and the last barrel of pitch had been rolled off the Wall two 
nights ago."
"They would soon run short of arrows as well, and there were no fletchers making more."
"And 
the night before last, a raven had come from the west, from Ser Denys Mallister."
"Bowen Marsh had 
chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower, it seemed, and then farther, down into the gloom 
of the Gorge."
"At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and 
won a bloody battle."
But the victory had been a costly one.
"More than a hundred brothers slain, among 
them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch."
"The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to 
the Shadow Tower sorely wounded."
"Maester Mullin was tending him, but it would be some time before 
he was fit to return to Castle Black."
"When he had read that, Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole's Town on their best horse to plead with the 
villagers to help man the Wall."
She never returned.
"When he sent Mully after her, he came back to report 
the whole village deserted, even the brothel."
"Most likely Zei had followed them, straight down the 
kingsroad."
"Maybe we should all do the same, Jon reflected glumly."
"He made himself eat, hungry or no."
"Bad enough he could not sleep, he could not go on without food as 
well."
"Besides, this might be my last meal."
It might be the last meal for all of us.
"So it was that Jon had a 
belly full of bread, bacon, onions, and cheese when he heard Horse shout, ""IT'S COMING!"""
"No one needed to ask what ""it"" was."
"Nor did Jon need the maester's Myrish eye to see it creeping out 
Page 619

from amongst the tents and trees."
"""It doesn't really look much like a turtle,"" Satin commented."
"""Turtles 
don't have fur."""
"""Most of them don't have wheels either,"" said Pyp."
"""Sound the warhorn,"" Jon commanded, and Kegs blew two long blasts, to wake Grenn and the other 
sleepers who'd had the watch during the night."
"If the wildlings were coming, the Wall would need every 
man."
"Gods know, we have fewenough."
"Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the 
Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to belly 
and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings, in the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only 
a few iron bars between them."
"That was what it would come down to, unless they could stop the turtle 
before the gate was breached."
"""It's big,"" Horse said."
Pyp smacked his lips.
"""Think of all the soup it will make."""
The jape was stillborn.
"Even Pyp sounded 
tired."
"He looks half dead, thought Jon, but so do we all."
"The King-beyond-the-Wall had so many men 
that he could throw fresh attackers at them every time, but the same handful of black brothers had to 
meet every assault, and it had worn them ragged."
"The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard, Jon knew, putting their shoulders into it, 
straining to keep the wheels turning, but once the turtle was flush against the gate they would exchange 
their ropes for axes."
At least Mance was not sending his mammoths today.
Jon was glad of that.
"Their 
awesome strength was wasted on the Wall, and their size only made them easy targets."
"The last had been 
a day and a half in the dying, its mournful trumpetings terrible to hear."
The turtle crept slowly through stones and stumps and brush.
"The earlier attacks had cost the free folk a 
hundred lives or more."
Most still lay where they had fallen.
"In the lulls the crows would come and pay 
them court, but now the birds fled screeching."
They liked the look of that turtle no more than he did.
"Satin, Horse, and the others were looking to him, Jon knew, waiting for his orders."
"He was so tired, he 
hardly knew any more."
"The Wall is mine, he reminded himself."
"""Owen, Horse, to the catapults."
"Kegs, 
you and Spare Boot on the scorpions."
The rest of you string your bows.
Fire arrows.
"Let's see if we can 
burn it."""
"It was likely to be a futile gesture, Jon knew, but it had to be better than standing helpless."
"Cumbersome and slow-moving, the turtle made for an easy shot, and his archers and crossbowmen 
soon turned it into a lumbering wooden hedgehog."
.
.
"but the wet hides protected it, just as they had the 
mantlets, and the flaming arrows guttered out almost as soon as they struck."
Jon cursed under his breath.
"""Scorpions,"" he commanded."
"""Catapults."""
"The scorpions bolts punched deep into the pelts, but did no more damage than the fire arrows."
"The 
rocks went bouncing off the turtle's roof, leaving dimples in the thick layers of hides."
"A stone from one of 
the trebuchets might have crushed it, but the one machine was still broken, and the wildlings had gone 
wide around the area where the other dropped its loads."
"""Jon, it's still coming,"" said Owen the Oaf."
He could see that for himself.
"Inch by inch, yard by yard, the turtle crept closer, rolling, rumbling and 
rocking as it crossed the killing ground."
"Once the wildlings got it flush against the Wall, it would give them 
all the shelter they needed while their axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates."
"Inside, under 
the ice, they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours, and then there would be 
Page 620

nothing to stop them but two iron gates, a few half-frozen corpses, and whatever brothers Jon cared to 
throw in their path, to fight and die down in the dark."
"To his left, the catapult made a thunk and filled the air with spinning stones."
"They plonked down on the 
turtle like hail, and caromed harmlessly aside."
"The wildling archers were still loosing arrows from behind 
their mantlets."
"One thudded into the face of a straw man, and Pyp said, ""Four for Watt of Long Lake!"
"We have a tie! """
"The next shaft whistled past his own ear, however."
"""Fie!"""
he shouted down.
"""I'm not in 
the tourney! """
"""The hides won't burn,"" Jon said, as much to himself as to the others."
"Their only hope was to try and 
crush the turtle when it reached the Wall."
"For that, they needed boulders."
"No matter how stoutly built the 
turtle was, a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of it from seven hundred feet was bound 
to do some damage."
"""Grenn, Owen, Kegs, it's time."""
Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were lined up in a row.
"They were full of 
crushed rock; the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give themselves 
better footing atop the Wall."
"Yesterday, after he'd seen the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins, 
Jon told Grerm to pour water into the barrels, as much as they would take."
"The water would seep down 
through the crushed stone, and overnight the whole thing would freeze solid."
"It was the nearest thing to a 
boulder they were going to get."
"""Why do we need to freeze it?"""
Grerm had asked him.
"""Why don't we just roll the barrels off the way 
they are?"""
"Jon answered, ""If they crash against the Wall on the way down they'll burst, and loose gravel will spray 
everywhere."
"We don't want to rain pebbles on the whoresons."""
"He put his shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn, while Kegs and Owen were wrestling with another."
Together they rocked it back and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around its bottom.
"""The bugger weighs a ton,"" said Grenn."
"""Tip it over and roll it,"" Jon said."
"""Careful, if it rolls over your foot you'll end up like Spare Boot."""
"Once the barrel was on its side, Jon grabbed a torch and waved it above the surface of the Wall, back 
and forth, just enough to melt the ice a little."
The thin film of water helped the barrel roll more easily.
"Too 
easily, in fact; they almost lost it."
"But finally, with four of them pooling their efforts, they rolled their 
boulder to the edge and stood it up again."
"They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted, ""There's a turtle at 
our door!"""
Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look.
"Hoardings, Marsh should have built 
hoardings."
So many things they should have done.
"The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away 
from the gate."
"Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them, and Jon thought he saw one man go 
down, but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself."
"He wondered what the free 
folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path, but then he saw."
"The turtle was almost as wide as a 
longhall, so they simply pushed it over the carcass."
"His leg twitched, but Horse caught his arm and drew 
him back to safety."
"""You shouldn't lean out like that,"" the boy said."
"""We should have built hoardings."""
"Jon thought he could hear the crash of axes on wood, but that was 
probably just fear ringing in his ears."
He looked to Grenn.
"""Do it."""
"Grerm got behind a barrel, put his shoulder against it, grunted, and began to push."
"Owen and Mully 
Page 621

moved to help him."
"They shoved the barrel out a foot, and then another."
And suddenly it was gone.
"They heard the thump as it struck the Wall on the way down, and 
then, much louder, the crash and crack of splintering wood, followed by shouts and screams."
"Satin 
whooped and Owen the Oaf danced in circles, while Pyp leaned out and called, ""The turtle was stuffed 
full of rabbits!"
"Look at them hop away!"""
"""Again,"" Jon barked, and Grerm and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel, and sent it 
tottering out into empty air."
"By the time they were done, the front of Mance's turtle was a crushed and splintered ruin, and wildlings 
were spilling out the other end and scrambling for their camp."
"Satin scooped up his crossbow and sent a 
few quarrels after them as they ran, to see them off the faster."
"Grenn was grinning through his beard, Pyp 
was making japes, and none of them would die today."
"On the morrow, though ... Jon glanced toward the shed."
"Eight barrels of gravel remained where twelve 
had stood a few moments before."
"He realized how tired he was then, and how much his wound was 
hurting."
I need to sleep.
"A few hours, at least."
"He could go to Maester Aemon for some dreamwine, that 
would help."
"""I am going down to the King's Tower,"" he told them."
"""Call me if Mance gets up to anything."
"Pyp, you have the Wall."""
"""Me?"""
said Pyp.
"""Him?"""
said Grenn.
"Smiling, he left them to it and rode down in the cage."
"A cup of dreamwine did help, as it happened."
"No sooner had he stretched out on the narrow bed in his 
cell than sleep took him."
"His dreams were strange and formless, full of strange voices, shouts and cries, 
and the sound of a warhorn, blowing low and loud, a single deep booming note that lingered in the air."
"When he awoke the sky was black outside the arrow slit that served him for a window, and four men he 
did not know were standing over him."
One held a lantern.
"""Jon Snow,"" the tallest of them said brusquely, 
""pull on your boots and come with us."""
"His first groggy thought was that somehow the Wall had fallen whilst he slept, that Mance Rayder had 
sent more giants or another turtle and broken through the gate."
"But when he rubbed his eyes he saw that 
the strangers were all in black."
"They're men of the Night's Watch, Jon realized."
"""Come where?"
"Who are 
you?"""
"The tall man gestured, and two of the others pulled Jon from the bed."
"With the lantern leading the way 
they marched him from his cell and up a half turn of stair, to the Old Bear's solar."
"He saw Maester 
Aemon standing by the fire, his hands folded around the head of a blackthorn cane."
"Septon Cellador was 
half drunk as usual, and Ser Wynton Stout was asleep in a window seat."
"The other brothers were 
strangers to him."
All but one.
"Immaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots, Ser Alliser 
Thorne turned to say, ""Here's the tumcloak now, my lord."
"Ned Stark's bastard, of Winterfell."""
"Page 622

""I'm no tumcloak, Thorne,"" Jon said coldly."
"""We shall see."""
"in the leather chair behind the table where the Old Bear wrote his letters sat a big, broad, 
jowly man Jon did not know."
"""Yes, we shall see,"" he said again."
"""You will not deny that you are Jon 
Snow, I hope?"
"Stark's bastard?"""
"""Lord Snow, he likes to call himself."""
"Ser Alliser was a spare, slim man, compact and sinewy, and just 
now his flinty eyes were dark with amusement."
"""You're the one who named me Lord Snow,"" said Jon."
"Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys he 
trained, during his time as Castle Black's master-at-arms."
"The Old Bear had sent Thorne to 
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea."
These others must be Eastwatch men.
"The bird reached Cotter Pyke and he's 
sent us help."
"""How many men have you brought?"""
he asked the man behind the table.
"""It's me who'll ask the questions,"" the jowly man replied."
"""You've been charged with oathbreaking, 
cowardice, and desertion, Jon Snow."
"Do you deny that you abandoned your brothers to die on the Fist 
of the First Men and joined the wildling Mance Rayder, this self-styled King-beyondthe-Wall? """
"""Abandoned ..."
"?"""
Jon almost choked on the word.
Maester Aemon spoke up then.
"""My lord, Donal Noye and I discussed these issues when Jon Snow 
first returned to us, and were satisfied by Jon's explanations."""
"""Well, I am not satisfied, Maester,"" said the jowly man."
"""I will hear these explanations for myself."
"Yes I 
will!"""
Jon swallowed his anger.
"""I abandoned no one."
"I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling 
Pass."
I joined the wildlings under orders.
"The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of 
Winter..."" 
""The Horn of Winter?"""
Ser Alliser chuckled.
"""Were you commanded to count their snarks as well, Lord 
Snow?"""
"""No, but I counted their giants as best I could."""
"""Ser,"" snapped the jowly man."
"""You will address Ser Alliser as ser, and myself as m'lord."
"I am Janos 
Slynt, Lord of Harrenhal, and commander here at Castle Black until such time as Bowen Marsh returns 
with his garrison."
"You will grant us our courtesies, yes."
"I will not suffer to hear an anointed knight like the 
good Ser Alliser mocked by a traitor's bastard."""
"He raised a hand and pointed a meaty finger at Jon's 
face."
"""Do you deny that you took a wildling woman into your bed?"""
"""No."""
Jon's grief over Ygritte was too fresh for him to deny her now.
"""No, my lord."""
"""I suppose it was also the Halfhand who commanded you to fuck this unwashed whore?"""
"Ser Alliser 
asked with a smirk."
"""Ser."
"She was no whore, ser."
"The Halfhand told me not to balk, whatever the wildlings asked of me, but 
..."
"I will not deny that I went beyond what I had to do, that I ... cared for her."""
"""You admit to being an oathbreaker, then,"" said Janos Slynt."
"Page 623

Half the men at Castle Black visited Mole's Town from time to time to dig for buried treasures in the 
brothel, Jon knew, but he would not dishonor Ygritte by equating her with the Mole's Town whores."
"""I 
broke my vows with a woman."
I admit that.
"Yes."""
"""Yes, m'lord!"""
"When Slynt scowled, his jowls quivered."
"He was as broad as the Old Bear had been, 
and no doubt would be as bald if he lived to Mormont's age."
"Half his hair was gone already, though he 
could not have been more than forty."
"""Yes, my lord,"" Jon said."
"""I rode with the wildlings and ate with them, as the Halfhand commanded me, 
and I shared my furs with Ygritte."
"But I swear to you, I never turned my cloak."
"I escaped the Magnar as 
soon as I could, and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm."""
Lord Slynt's small eyes studied him.
"""Ser Glendon,"" he commanded, ""bring in the other prisoner."""
Ser Glendon was the tall man who had dragged Jon from his bed.
"Four other men went with him when 
he left the room, but they were back soon enough with a captive, a small, sallow, battered man fettered 
hand and foot."
"He had a single eyebrow, a widow's peak, and a mustache that looked like a smear of 
dirt on his upper lip, but his face was swollen and mottled with bruises, and most of his front teeth had 
been knocked out."
The Eastwatch men threw the captive roughly to the floor.
Lord Slynt frowned down at him.
"""Is this the 
one you spoke of?"""
The captive blinked yellow eyes.
"""Aye."""
Not until that instant did Jon recognize Rattleshirt.
"He is a 
different man without his armor, he thought."
"""Aye,"" the wildling repeated, ""he's the craven killed the 
Halfhand."
"Up in the Frostfangs, it were, after we hunted down Vother crows and killed them, every one."
"We would have done for this one too, only he begged P his worthless life, offered t' join us if we'd have 
him."
"The Halfhand swore he'd see the craven dead first, but the wolf ripped Qhorin half t' pieces and this 
one opened his throat."""
"He gave Jon a cracktooth smile then, and spat blood on his foot."
"""Well?"""
Janos Slynt demanded of Jon harshly.
"""Do you deny it?"
"Or will you claim Qhorin commanded 
you to kill him?"""
"""He told me..."" The words came hard."
"""He told me to do whatever they asked of me."""
"Slynt looked about the solar, at the other Eastwatch men."
"""Does this boy think I fell off a turnip wagon 
onto my head?"""
"""Your lies won't save you now, Lord Snow,"" warned Ser Alliser Thorne."
"""We'll have the truth from you, 
bastard."""
"""I've told you the truth."
"Our garrons were failing, and Rattleshirt was close behind us."
"Qhorin told me to 
pretend to join the wildlings."
"'You must not balk, whatever is asked of you,' he said."
"He knew they would 
make me kill him."
"Rattleshirt was going to kill him anyway, he knew that too."""
"""So now you claim the great Qhorin Halfhand feared this creature?"""
"Slynt looked at Rattleshirt, and 
snorted."
"""All men fear the Lord o' Bones,"" the wildling grumbled."
"Ser Glendon kicked him, and he lapsed back 
into silence."
"Page 624

""I never said that,"" Jon insisted."
Slynt slammed a fist on the table.
"""I heard you!"
"Ser Alliser had your measure true enough, it seems."
"You 
lie through your bastard's teeth."
"Well, I will not suffer it."
I will not!
"You might have fooled this crippled 
blacksmith, but not Janos Slynt!"
"Oh, no."
Janos Slynt does not swallow lies so easily.
"Did you think my 
skull was stuffed with cabbage?"""
"""I don't know what your skull is stuffed with."
"My lord."""
"""Lord Snow is nothing if not arrogant,"" said Ser Alliser."
"""He murdered Qhorin just as his fellow 
turncloaks did Lord Mormont."
it would not surprise me to learn that it was all part of the same fell plot.
Benjen Stark may well have a hand in all this as well.
"For all we know, he is sitting in Mance Rayder's 
tent even now."
"You know these Starks, my lord."""
"""I do,"" said Janos Slynt."
"""I know them too well."""
Jon peeled off his glove and showed them his burned hand.
"""I burned my hand defending Lord Mormont 
from a wight."
And my uncle was a man of honor.
"He would never have betrayed his vows."""
"""No more than you?"""
mocked Ser Alliser.
Septon Cellador cleared his throat.
"""Lord Slynt,"" he said, ""this boy refused to swear his vows properly in 
the sept, but went beyond the Wall to say his words before a heart tree."
"His father's gods, he said, but 
they are wildling gods as well."""
"""They are the gods of the north, Septon."""
"Maester Aemon was courteous, but firm."
"""My lords, when 
Donal Noye was slain, it was this young man Jon Snow who took the Wall and held it, against all the fury 
of the north."
"He has proved himself valiant, loyal, and resourceful."
"Were it not for him, you would have 
found Mance Rayder sitting here when you arrived, Lord Slynt."
You are doing him a great wrong.
"Jon 
Snow was Lord Mormont's own steward and squire."
"He was chosen for that duty because the Lord 
Commander saw much promise in him."
"As do I"" ""Promise?"""
said Slynt.
"""Well, promise may turn false."
Qhorin Halfhand's blood is on his hands.
"Mormont trusted him, you say, but what of that?"
"I know what it 
is to be betrayed by men you trusted."
"Oh, yes."
"And I know the ways of wolves as well."""
He pointed at Jon's face.
"""Your father died a traitor."""
"""My father was murdered."""
"Jon was past caring what they did to him, but he would not suffer any more 
lies about his father."
Slynt purpled.
"""Murder?"
You insolent pup.
"King Robert was not even cold when Lord Eddard moved 
against his son."""
"He rose to his feet; a shorter man than Mormont, but thick about the chest and arms, 
with a gut to match."
A small gold spear tipped with red enamel pinned his cloak at the shoulder.
"""Your 
father died by the sword, but he was highborn, a King's Hand."
"For you, a noose will serve."
"Ser Alliser, 
take this tumcloak to an ice cell."""
"""My lord is wise."""
Ser Alliser seized Jon by the arm.
Jon yanked away and grabbed the knight by the throat with such ferocity that he lifted him off the floor.
He would have throttled him if the Eastwatch men had not pulled him off.
"Thorne staggered back, 
rubbing the marks Jon's fingers had left on his neck."
"""You see for yourselves, brothers."
"The boy is a 
wildling."""
"Page 625

Chapter 70 
TYRION 
When dawn broke, he found he could not face the thought of food."
By evenfall I may stand condemned.
"His belly was acid with bile, and his nose itched."
Tyrion scratched at it with the point of his knife.
"One 
last witness to endure, then my turn."
But what to do?
Deny everything?
Accuse Sansa and Ser Dontos?
"Confess, in the hope of spending the rest of his days on the Wall?"
"Let the dice fly and pray the Red Viper 
could defeat Ser Gregor Clegane?"
"Tyrion stabbed listlessly at a greasy grey sausage, wishing it were his sister."
"It is bloody cold on the 
Wall, but at least I would be shut of Cersei."
"He did not think he would make much of a ranger, but the 
Night's Watch needed clever men as well as strong ones."
"Lord Commander Mormont had said as much, 
when Tyrion had visited Castle Black."
"There are those inconvenient vows, though."
"It would mean the end 
of his marriage and whatever claim he might ever have made for Casterly Rock, but he did not seem 
destined to enjoy either in any case."
And he seemed to recall that there was a brothel in a nearby village.
"it was not a life he'd ever dreamed of, but it was life."
"And all he had to do to earn it was trust in his 
father, stand up on his little stunted legs, and say, ""Yes, I did it, I confess."""
"That was the part that tied his 
bowels in knots."
"He almost wished he had done it, since it seemed he must suffer for it anyway."
"""My lord?"""
said Podrick Payne.
"""They're here, my lord."
Ser Addam.
And the gold cloaks.
"They wait 
without."""
"""Pod, tell me true ... do you think I did it?"""
The boy hesitated.
"When he tried to speak, all he managed to produce was a weak sputter."
I am doomed.
Tyrion sighed.
"""No need to answer."
You've been a good squire to me.
"Better than I 
deserved."
"Whatever happens, I thank you for your leal service."""
Ser Addarn Marbrand waited at the door with six gold cloaks.
"He had nothing to say this morning, it 
seemed."
Another good man who thinks me a kinslayer.
"Tyrion summoned all the dignity he could find and 
waddled down the steps."
"He could feel them all watching him as he crossed the yard; the guards on the 
walls, the grooms by the stables, the scullions and washerwomen and serving girls."
"Inside the throne 
room, knights and lordlings moved aside to let them through, and whispered to their ladies."
No sooner had Tyrion taken his place before the judges than another group of gold cloaks led in Shae.
A cold hand tightened round his heart.
"Varys betrayed her, he thought."
Then he remembered.
No.
"I 
betrayed her myself."
I should have left her with Lollys.
"Of course they'd question Sansa's maids, I'd do 
the same."
"Tyrion rubbed at the slick scar where his nose had been, wondering why Cersei had bothered."
Shae knows nothing that can hurt me.
"""They plotted it together,"" she said, this girl he'd loved."
"""The Imp and Lady Sansa plotted it after the 
Young Wolf died."
Sansa wanted revenge for her brother and Tyrion meant to have the throne.
"He was 
Page 626

going to kill his sister next, and then his own lord father, so he could be Hand for Prince Tommen."
"But 
after a year or so, before Tornmen got too old, he would have killed him too, so as to take the crown for 
his own head."""
"""How could you know all this?"""
demanded Prince Oberyn.
"""Why would the Imp divulge such plans to 
his wife's maid?"""
"""I overheard some, m'lord,"" said Shae, ""and m'lady let things slip too."
But most I had from his own lips.
"I 
wasn't only Lady Sansa's maid."
"I was his whore, all the time he was here in King's Landing."
"On the 
morning of the wedding, he dragged me down where they keep the dragon skulls and fucked me there 
with the monsters all around."
"And when I cried, he said I ought to be more grateful, that it wasn't every 
girl who got to be the king's whore."
That was when he told me how he meant to be king.
"He said that 
poor boy Joffrey would never know his bride the way he was knowing me."""
She started sobbing then.
"""I 
never meant to be a whore, m'lords."
I was to be married.
"A squire, he was, and a good brave boy, 
gentle born."
"But the Imp saw me at the Green Fork and put the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of 
the van, and after he was killed he sent his wildlings to bring me to his tent."
"Shagga, the big one, and 
Timett with the burned eye."
"He said if I didn't pleasure him, he'd give me to 
them, so I did."
"Then he brought me to the city, so I'd be close when he wanted me."
"He made me do 
such shameful things ."
.
". """
Prince Oberyn looked curious.
"""What sorts of things?"""
"""Unspeakable things."""
"As the tears rolled slowly down that pretty face, no doubt every man in the hall 
wanted to take Shae in his arms and comfort her."
"""With my mouth and ... other parts, m'lord."
"All my 
parts."
"He used me every way there was, and ... he used to make me tell him how big he was."
"My giant, I 
had to call him, my giant of Lannister."""
Oswald Kettleblack was the first to laugh.
"Boros and Meryn joined in, then Cersei, Ser Loras, and more 
lords and ladies than he could count."
"The sudden gale of mirth made the rafters ring and shook the Iron 
Throne."
"""It's true,"" Shae protested."
"""My giant of Lannister."""
The laughter swelled twice as loud.
"Their 
mouths were twisted in merriment, their bellies shook."
"Some laughed so hard that snot flew from their 
nostrils."
"I saved you all, Tyrion thought."
I saved this vile city and all your worthless lives.
"There were hundreds in 
the throne room, every one of them laughing but his father."
Or so it seemed.
"Even the Red Viper 
chortled, and Mace Tyrell looked like to bust a gut, but Lord Tywin Lannister sat between them as if 
made of stone, his fingers steepled beneath his chin."
Tyrion pushed forward.
"""MY LORDS!"""
he shouted.
"He had to shout, to have any hope of being heard."
His father raised a hand.
"Bit by bit, the hall grew silent."
"""Get this lying whore out of my sight,"" said Tyrion, ""and I will give you your confession."""
"Lord Tywin nodded, gestured."
Shae looked half in terror as the gold cloaks formed up around her.
"Her 
eyes met Tyrion's as they marched her from the wall."
"Was it shame he saw there, or fear?"
"He wondered 
what Cersei had promised her."
"You will get the gold or jewels, whatever it was you asked for, he thought 
as he watched her back recede, but before the moon has turned she'll have you entertaining the gold 
cloaks in their barracks."
"Page 627

Tyrion stared up at his father's hard green eyes with their flecks of cold bright gold."
"""Guilty,"" he said, ""so 
guilty."
"Is that what you wanted to hear? """
Lord Tywin said nothing.
Mace Tyrell nodded.
Prince Oberyn looked mildly disappointed.
"""You admit 
you poisoned the king?"""
"""Nothing of the sort,"" said Tyrion."
"""Of Joffrey's death I am innocent."
"I am guilty of a more monstrous 
crime."""
He took a step toward his father.
"""I was born."
I lived.
"I am guilty of being a dwarf, I confess it."
"And no matter how many times my good father forgave me, I have persisted in my infamy."""
"""This is folly, Tyrion,"" declared Lord Tywin."
"""Speak to the matter at hand."
"You are not on trial for being 
a dwarf."""
"""That is where you err, my lord."
"I have been on trial for being a dwarf my entire life."""
"""Have you nothing to say in your defense?"""
"""Nothing but this: I did not do it."
"Yet now I wish I had."""
"He turned to face the hall, that sea of pale faces."
"""I wish I had enough poison for you all."
"You make me sorry that I am not the monster you would have 
me be, yet there it is."
"I am innocent, but I will get no justice here."
"You leave me no choice but to appeal 
to the gods."
"I demand trial by battle."""
"""Have you taken leave of your wits?"""
his father said.
"""No, I've found them."
"I demand trial by battle!"""
His sweet sister could not have been more pleased.
"""He has that right, my lords,"" she reminded the 
judges."
"""Let the gods judge."
Ser Gregor Clegane will stand for Joffrey.
"He returned to the city the night 
before last, to put his sword at my service."""
"Lord Tywin's face was so dark that for half a heartbeat Tyrion wondered if he'd drunk some poisoned 
wine as well."
"He slammed his fist down on the table, too angry to speak."
"It was Mace Tyrell who turned 
to Tyrion and asked the question."
"""Do you have a champion to defend your innocence?"""
"""He does, my lord."""
Prince Oberyn of Dome rose to his feet.
"""The dwarf has quite convinced me."""
The uproar was deafening.
"Tyrion took especial pleasure in the sudden doubt he glimpsed in Cersei's 
eyes."
"It took a hundred gold cloaks pounding the butts of their spears against the floor to quiet the throne 
room again."
By then Lord Tywin Lannister had recovered himself.
"""Let the issue be decided on the 
morrow,"" he declared in iron tones."
"""I wash my hands of it."""
"He gave his dwarf son a cold angry look, 
then strode from the hall, out the king's door behind the Iron Throne, his brother Kevan at his side."
"Later, back in his tower cell, Tyrion poured himself a cup of wine and sent Podrick Payne off for 
cheese, bread, and olives."
He doubted whether he could keep down anything heavier just now.
"Did you 
think I would go meekly, Father?"
he asked the shadow his candles etched upon the wall.
"I have too 
much of you in me for that."
"He felt strangely at peace, now that he had snatched the power of life and 
death from his father's hands and placed it in the hands of the gods."
"Assuming there are gods, and they 
give a mummer's fart."
"If not, then I'm in Domish hands."
"No matter what happened, Tyrion had the 
satisfaction of knowing that he'd kicked Lord Tywin's plans to splinters."
"If Prince Oberyn won, it would 
further inflame Highgarden against the Domish; Mace Tyrell would see the man who crippled his son 
helping the dwarf who almost poisoned his daughter to escape his rightful punishment."
"And if the 
Page 628

Mountain triumphed, Doran Martell might well demand to know why his brother had been served with 
death instead of the justice Tyrion had promised him."
Dome might crown Myrcella after all.
It was almost worth dying to know all the trouble he'd made.
"Will you come to see the end, Shae?"
"Will 
you stand there with the rest, watching as Ser llyn lops my ugly head off?"
"Will you miss your giant of 
Lannister when he's dead?"
"He drained his wine, flung the cup aside, and sang lustily."
"He rode through the streets of the city, down from his hill on high, 
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, he rode to a woman's sigh."
"For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss."
"And a chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman's kiss."
Ser Kevan did not visit him that night.
"He was probably with Lord Tywin, trying to placate the Tyrells."
"I 
have seen the last of that uncle, I fear."
He poured another cup of wine.
"A pity he'd had Symon Silver 
Tongue killed before learning all the words of that song."
"It wasn't a bad song, if truth be told."
"Especially 
compared to the ones that would be written about him henceforth."
"""For hands of gold are always cold, 
but a woman's hands are warm,"" he sang."
Perhaps he should write the other verses himself.
"If he lived so 
long."
"That night, surprisingly, Tyrion Larmister slept long and deep."
"He rose at first light, well rested and with a 
hearty appetite, and broke his fast on fried bread, blood sausage, applecakes, and a double helping of 
eggs cooked with onions and fiery Dornish peppers."
"Then he begged leave of his guards to attend his 
champion."
Ser Addam gave his consent.
Tyrion found Prince Oberyn drinking a cup of red wine as he donned his armor.
"He was attended by 
four of his younger Dornish lordlings."
"""Good morrow to you, my lord,"" the prince said."
"""Will you take a 
cup of wine? """
"""Should you be drinking before battle?"""
"""I always drink before battle."""
"""That could get you killed."
"Worse, it could get me killed."""
Prince Oberyn laughed.
"""The gods defend the innocent."
"You are innocent, I trust?"""
"""Only of killing Joffrey,"" Tyrion admitted."
"""I do hope you know what you are about to face."
"Gregor 
Clegane is - 
"" - large?"
"So I have heard."""
"""He is almost eight feet tall and must weigh thirty stone, all of it muscle."
"He fights with a two-handed 
greatsword, but needs only one hand to wield it."
"He has been known to cut men in half with a single 
blow."
"His armor is so heavy that no lesser man could bear the weight, let alone move in it."""
Prince Oberyn was unimpressed.
"""I have killed large men before."
The trick is to get them off their feet.
"Once they go down, they're dead."""
"The Domishman sounded so blithely confident that Tyrion felt almost 
Page 629

reassured, until he turned and said, ""Daemon, my spear!"""
"Ser Daemon tossed it to him, and the Red 
Viper snatched it from the air."
"""You mean to face the Mountain with a spear?"""
That made Tyrion uneasy all over again.
"In battle, ranks 
of massed spears made for a formidable front, but single combat against a skilled swordsman was a very 
different matter."
"""We are fond of spears in Dome."
"Besides, it is the only way to counter his reach."
"Have a look, Lord 
Imp, but see you do not touch."""
"The spear was turned ash eight feet long, the shaft smooth, thick, and 
heavy."
The last two feet of that was steel: a slender leaf-shaped spearhead narrowing to a wicked spike.
The edges looked sharp enough to shave with.
"When Oberyn spun the haft between the palms of his 
hand, they glistened black."
Oil?
Or poison?
Tyrion decided that he would sooner not know.
"""I hope you 
are good with that,"" he said doubtfully."
"""You will have no cause for complaint."
Though Ser Gregor may.
"However thick his plate, there will be 
gaps at the joints."
"Inside the elbow and knee, beneath the arms ..."
"I will find a place to tickle him, I 
promise you."""
He set the spear aside.
"""It is said that a Lannister always pays his debts."
"Perhaps you will 
return to Sunspear with me when the day's bloodletting is done."
"My brother Doran would be most 
pleased to meet the rightful heir to Casterly Rock ... especially if he brought his lovely wife, the Lady of 
Winterfell."""
"Does the snake think I have Sansa squirreled away somewhere, like a nut I'm hoarding for winter?"
"If so, 
Tyrion was not about to disabuse him."
"""A trip to Dome might be very pleasant, now that I reflect on it."""
"""Plan on a lengthy visit."""
Prince Oberyn sipped his wine.
"""You and Doran have many matters of mutual 
interest to discuss."
"Music, trade, history, wine, the dwarf's penny ... the laws of inheritance and 
succession."
"No doubt an uncle's counsel would be of benefit to Queen Myrcella in the trying times 
ahead."""
"If Varys had his little birds listening, Oberyn was giving them a ripe earful."
"""I believe I will have that cup 
of wine,"" said Tyrion."
Queen Myrcella?
"It would have been more tempting if only he did have Sansa 
tucked beneath his cloak."
"If she declared for Myrcella over Tommen, would the north follow?"
"What the 
Red Viper was hinting at was treason."
"Could Tyrion truly take up arms against Tommen, against his own 
father?"
Cersei would spit blood.
It might be worth it for that alone.
"""Do you recall the tale I told you of our first meeting, Imp?"""
"Prince 
Oberyn asked, as the Bastard of Godsgrace knelt before him to fasten his greaves."
"""It was not for your 
tail alone that my sister and I came to Casterly Rock."
We were on a quest of sorts.
"A quest that took us 
to Starfall, the Arbor, Oldtown, the Shield Islands, Crakehall, and finally Casterly Rock ... but our true 
destination was marriage."
"Doran was betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos, so he had been left behind 
as castellan of Sunspear."
My sister and I were yet unpromised.
"""Elia found it all exciting."
"She was of that age, and her delicate health had never permitted her much 
travel."
I preferred to amuse myself by mocking my sister's suitors.
"There was Little Lord Lazyeye, Squire 
Squishlips, one I named the Whale That Walks, that sort of thing."
"The only one who was even halfway 
presentable was young Baelor Hightower."
"A pretty lad, and my sister was half in love with him until he 
had the misfortune to fart once in our presence."
"I promptly named him Baelor Breakwind, and after that 
Elia couldn't look at him without laughing."
"I was a monstrous young fellow, someone should have sliced 
out my vile tongue."""
"Page 630

Yes, Tyrion agreed silently."
"Baelor Hightower was no longer young, but he remained Lord Leyton's heir; 
wealthy, handsome, and a knight of splendid repute."
"Baelor Brightsmile, they called him now."
"Had Elia 
wed him in place of Rhaegar Targaryen, she might be in Oldtown with her children growing tall around 
her."
He wondered how many lives had been snuffed out by that fart.
"""Lannisport was the end of our voyage,"" Prince Oberyn went on, as Ser Arron Qorgyle helped him into 
a padded leather tunic and began lacing it up the back."
"""Were you aware that our mothers knew each 
other of old? """
"""They had been at court together as girls, I seem to recall."
"Companions to Princess Rhaella?"""
"""Just so."
It was my belief that the mothers had cooked up this plot between them.
"Squire Squishlips and 
his ilk and the various pimply young maidens who'd been paraded before me were the almonds before 
the feast, meant only to whet our appetites."
"The main course was to be served at Casterly Rock."""
"""Cersei and Jaime."""
"""Such a clever dwarf."
"Elia and I were older, to be sure."
"Your brother and sister could not have been 
more than eight or nine."
"Still, a difference of five or six years is little enough."
"And there was an empty 
cabin on our ship, a very nice cabin, such as might be kept for a person of high birth."
"As if it were 
intended that we take someone back to Sunspear."
"A young page, perhaps."
Or a companion for Elia.
"Your lady mother meant to betroth Jaime to my sister, or Cersei to me."
"Perhaps both."""
"""Perhaps,"" said Tyrion, ""but my father - "" 
ruled the Seven Kingdoms, but was ruled at home by his lady wife, or so my mother always said."""
"Prince Oberyn raised his arms, so Lord Dagos Manwoody and the Bastard of Godsgrace could slip a 
chainmail bymie down over his head."
"""At Oldtown we learned of your mother's death, and the monstrous 
child she had borne."
"We might have turned back there, but my mother chose to sail on."
"I told you of the 
welcome we found at Casterly Rock."
"""What I did not tell you was that my mother waited as long as was decent, and then broached your 
father about our purpose."
"Years later, on her deathbed, she told me that Lord Tywin had refused us 
brusquely."
"His daughter was meant for Prince Rhaegar, he informed her."
"And when she asked for Jaime, 
to espouse Elia, he offered her you instead."""
"""Which offer she took for an outrage."""
"""It was."
"Even you can see that, surely?"""
"""Oh, surely."""
"It all goes back and back, Tyrion thought, to our mothers and fathers and theirs before 
them."
"We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own 
children will take up our strings and dance on in our steads."
"""Well, Prince Rhaegar married Elia of Dome, 
not Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock."
"So it would seem your mother won that tilt."""
"""She thought so,"" Prince Oberyn agreed, ""but your father is not a man to forget such slights."
"He taught 
that lesson to Lord and Lady Tarbeck once, and to the Reynes of Castamere."
"And at King's Landing, he 
taught it to my sister."
"My helm, Dagos."""
"Manwoody handed it to him; a high golden helm with a copper 
disk mounted on the brow, the sun of Dome."
"The visor had been removed, Tyrion saw."
"""Elia and her 
children have waited long for justice."""
"Prince Oberyn pulled on soft red leather gloves, and took up his 
spear again."
"""But this day they shall have it."""
"Page 631

The outer ward had been chosen for the combat."
"Tyrion had to skip and run to keep up with Prince 
Oberyn's long strides."
"The snake is eager, he thought."
Let us hope he is venomous as well.
"The day was 
grey and windy."
"The sun was struggling to break through the clouds, but Tyrion could no more have said 
who was going to win that fight than the one on which his life depended."
It looked as though a thousand people had come to see if he would live or die.
"They lined the castle 
wallwalks and elbowed one another on the steps of keeps and towers."
"They watched from the stable 
doors, from windows and bridges, from balconies and roofs."
"And the yard was packed with them, so 
many that the gold cloaks and the knights of the Kingsguard had to shove them back to make enough 
room for the fight."
"Some had dragged out chairs to watch more comfortably, while others perched on 
barrels."
"We should have done this in the Dragonpit, Tyrion thought 
sourly."
We could have charged a penny a head and paid for Joffrey's wedding and funeral both.
"Some 
of the onlookers even had small children sitting on their shoulders, to get a better view."
"They shouted and 
pointed at the sight of Tyrion."
Cersei seemed half a child herself beside Ser Gregor.
"In his armor, the Mountain looked bigger than any 
man had any right to be."
"Beneath a long yellow surcoat bearing the three black dogs of Clegane, he wore 
heavy plate over chainmail, dull grey steel dinted and scarred in battle."
"Beneath that would be boiled 
leather and a layer of quilting."
"A flat-topped greathelm was bolted to his gorget, with breaths around the 
mouth and nose and a narrow slit for vision."
The crest atop it was a stone fist.
"If Ser Gregor was suffering from wounds, Tyrion could see no sign of it from across the yard."
"He looks 
as though he was chiseled out of rock, standing there."
"His greatsword was planted in the ground before 
him, six feet of scarred metal."
"Ser Gregor's huge hands, clad in gauntlets of lobstered steel, clasped the 
crosshilt to either side of the grip."
Even Prince Oberyn's paramour paled at the sight of him.
"""You are 
going to fight that?"""
Ellaria Sand said in a hushed voice.
"""I am going to kill that,"" her lover replied carelessly."
"Tyrion had his own doubts, now that they stood on the brink."
"When he looked at Prince Oberyn, he 
found himself wishing he had Bronn defending him ... or even better, Jaime."
"The Red Viper was lightly 
armored; greaves, vambraces, gorget, spaulder, steel codpiece."
Elsewise Oberyn.
"was clad in supple 
leather and flowing silks."
"Over his byrnie he wore his scales of gleaming copper, but mail and scale 
together would not give him a quarter the protection of Gregor's heavy plate."
"With its visor removed, the 
prince's helm was effectively no better than a halfhelm, lacking even a nasal."
"His round steel shield was 
brightly polished, and showed the sun-and-spear in red gold, yellow gold, white gold, and copper."
"Dance around him until he's so tired he can hardly lift his arm, then put him on his back."
"The Red Viper 
seemed to have the same notion as Bronn."
"But the sellsword had been blunt about the risks of such 
tactics."
"I hope to seven hells that you know what you are doing, snake."
"A platform had been erected beside the Tower of the Hand, halfway between the two champions."
"That 
was where Lord Tywin sat with his brother Ser Kevan."
"King Tommen was not in evidence; for that, at 
least, Tyrion was grateful."
"Lord Tywin glanced briefly at his dwarf son, then lifted his hand."
"A dozen trumpeters blew a fanfare to 
quiet the crowd."
"The High Septon shuffled forward in his tall crystal crown, and prayed that the Father 
Above would help them in this judgment, and that the Warrior would lend his strength to the arm of the 
man whose cause was just."
"That 
Page 632

would be me, Tyrion almost shouted, but they would only laugh, and he was sick unto death of laughter."
"Ser Osmund Kettleblack brought Clegane his shield, a massive thing of heavy oak rimmed in black iron."
"As the Mountain slid his left arm through the straps, Tyrion saw that the hounds of Clegane had been 
painted over."
"This morning Ser Gregor bore the seven-pointed star the Andals had brought to Westeros 
when they crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the First Men and their gods."
"Very pious of you, 
Cersei, but I doubt the gods will be impressed."
There were fifty yards between them.
"Prince Oberyn advanced quickly, Ser Gregor more ominously."
"The ground does not shake when he walks, Tyrion told himself."
That is only my heart fluttering.
"When the 
two men were ten yards apart, the Red Viper stopped and called out, ""Have they told you who I am?"""
Ser Gregor grunted through his breaths.
"""Some dead man."""
"He came on, inexorable."
The Domishman slid sideways.
"""I am Oberyn Martell, a prince of Dome,"" he said, as the Mountain 
turned to keep him in sight."
"""Princess Elia was my sister."""
"""Who?"""
asked Gregor Clegane.
"Oberyn's long spear jabbed, but Ser Gregor took the point on his shield, shoved it aside, and bulled 
back at the prince, his great sword flashing."
The Domishman spun away untouched.
"The spear darted 
forward."
"Clegane slashed at it, Martell snapped it back, then thrust again."
"Metal screamed on metal as 
the spearhead slid off the Mountain's chest, slicing through the surcoat and leaving a long bright scratch 
on the steel beneath."
"""Elia Martell, Princess of Dome,"" the Red Viper hissed."
"""You raped her."
"You 
murdered her."
"You killed her children."""
Ser Gregor grunted.
He made a ponderous charge to hack at the Domishman's head.
"Prince Oberyn 
avoided him easily."
"""You raped her."
You murdered her.
"You killed her children."""
"""Did you come to talk or to fight?"""
"""I came to hear you confess."""
"The Red Viper landed a quick thrust on the Mountain's belly, to no effect."
"Gregor cut at him, and missed."
The long spear lanced in above his sword.
"Like a serpent's tongue it 
flickered in and out, feinting low and landing high, jabbing at groin, shield, eyes."
"The Mountain makes for 
a big target, at the least, Tyrion thought."
"Prince Oberyn could scarcely miss, though none of his blows 
was penetrating Ser Gregor's heavy plate."
"The Dornishman kept circling, jabbing, then darting back 
again, forcing the bigger man to turn and turn again."
Clegane is losing sight of him.
"The Mountain's helm 
had a narrow eyeslit, severely limiting his vision."
"Oberyn was making good use of that, and the length of 
his spear, and his quickness."
It went on that way for what seemed a long time.
"Back and forth they moved across the yard, and round 
and round in spirals, Ser Gregor slashing at the air while Oberyn's spear struck at arm, and leg, twice at 
his temple."
"Gregor's big wooden shield took its share of hits as well, until a dog's head peeped out from 
under the star, and elsewhere the raw oak showed through."
"Clegane would grunt from time to time, and 
once Tyrion heard him mutter a curse, but otherwise he fought in a sullen silence."
Not Oberyn Martell.
"""You raped her,"" he called, feinting."
"""You murdered her,"" he said, dodging a 
looping cut from Gregor's greatsword."
"""You killed her children,"" he shouted, slamming the spearpoint into 
the giant's throat, only to have it glance off the thick steel gorget with a screech."
"Page 633

""Oberyn is toying with him,"" said Ellaria Sand."
"That is fool's play, thought Tyrion."
"""The Mountain is too bloody big to be any man's toy."""
"All around the yard, the throng of spectators was creeping in toward the two combatants, edging 
forward inch by inch to get a better view."
"The Kingsguard tried to keep them back, shoving at the 
gawkers forcefully with their big white shields, but there were hundreds of gawkers and only six of the 
men in white armor."
"""You raped her."""
Prince Oberyn parried a savage cut with his spearhead.
"""You murdered her."""
"He sent 
the spearpoint at Clegane's eyes, so fast the huge man flinched back."
"""You killed her children."""
"The spear 
flickered sideways and down, scraping against the Mountain's breastplate."
"""You raped her."
"You 
murdered her."
"You killed her children."""
"The spear was two feet longer than Ser Gregor's sword, more 
than enough to keep him at an awkward distance."
"He hacked at the shaft whenever Oberyn lunged at 
him, trying to lop off the spearhead, but he might as well have been trying to hack the wings off a fly."
"""You raped her."
You murdered her.
"You killed her children."""
"Gregor tried to bull rush, but Oberyn 
skipped aside and circled round his back."
"""You raped her."
You murdered her.
"You killed her children."""
"""Be quiet."""
"Ser Gregor seemed to be moving a little slower, and his greatsword no longer rose quite so 
high as it had when the contest began."
"""Shut your bloody mouth."""
"""You raped her,"" the prince said, moving to the right."
"""Enough!"""
"Ser Gregor took two long strides and brought his sword down at Oberyn's head, but the 
Domishman backstepped once more."
"""You murdered her,"" he said."
"""SHUT UP"" Gregor charged headlong, right at the point of the spear, which slammed into his right 
breast then slid aside with a hideous steel shriek."
"Suddenly the Mountain was close enough to strike, his 
huge sword flashing in a steel blur."
The crowd was screaming as well.
"Oberyn slipped the first blow and 
let go of the spear, useless now that Ser Gregor was 
inside it."
The second cut the Domishman caught on his shield.
"Metal met metal with an ear-splitting 
clan& sending the Red Viper reeling."
"Ser Gregor followed, bellowing."
"He doesn't use words, he just 
roars like an animal, Tyrion thought."
"Oberyn's retreat became a headlong backward flight mere inches 
ahead of the greatsword as it slashed at his chest, his arms, his head."
The stable was behind him.
Spectators screamed and shoved at each other to get out of the way.
"One 
stumbled into Oberyn's back."
Ser Gregor hacked down with all his savage strength.
"The Red Viper 
threw himself sideways, rolling."
The luckless stableboy behind him was not so quick.
"As his arm rose to 
protect his face, Gregor's sword took it off between elbow and shoulder."
"""Shut UP!"""
"the Mountain 
howled at the stableboy's scream, and this time he swung the blade sideways, sending the top half of the 
lad's head across the yard in a spray of blood and brains."
"Hundreds of spectators suddenly seemed to 
lose all interest in the guilt or innocence of Tyrion Lannister, judging by the way they pushed and shoved 
at each other to escape the yard."
"But the Red Viper of Dome was back on his feet, his long spear in hand."
"""Elia,"" he called at Ser Gregor."
"""You raped her."
You murdered her.
You killed her children.
"Now say her name."""
The Mountain whirled.
"Helm, shield, sword, surcoat; he was spattered with gore from head to heels."
"""You talk too much,"" he grumbled."
"""You make my head hurt."""
"Page 634

""I will hear you say it."
"She was Elia of Dome."""
"The Mountain snorted contemptuously, and came on ... and in that moment, the sun broke through the 
low clouds that had hidden the sky since dawn."
"The sun of Dorne, Tyrion told himself, but it was Gregor Clegane who moved first to put the sun at his 
back."
"This is a dim and brutal man, but he has a warrior's instincts."
"The Red Viper crouched, squinting, and sent his spear darting forward again."
"Ser Gregor hacked at it, 
but the thrust had only been a feint."
"Off balance, he stumbled forward a step."
Prince Oberyn tilted his dinted metal shield.
"A shaft of sunlight blazed blindingly off polished gold and 
copper, into the narrow slit of his foe's helm."
Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare.
"Prince 
Oberyn's spear flashed like lightning and found the gap in the heavy plate, the joint under the arm."
"The 
point punched through mail and boiled leather."
"Gregor gave a choked grunt as the Domishman twisted his 
spear and yanked it free."
"""Elia."
Say it!
Elia.
"of Dome!"""
He was circlin& spear poised for another thrust.
"""Say it!"""
Tyrion had his own prayer.
"Fall down and die, was how it went."
"Damn you, fall down and die!"
"The 
blood trickling from the Mountain's armpit 
was his own now, and he must be bleeding even more heavily inside the breastplate."
"When he tried to 
take a step, one knee buckled."
Tyrion thought he was going down.
Prince Oberyn had circled behind him.
"""ELIA OF DORNE!"""
he shouted.
"Ser Gregor started to turn, but 
too slow and too late."
"The spearhead went through the back of the knee this time, through the layers of 
chain and leather between the plates on thigh and calf."
"The Mountain reeled, swayed, then collapsed face 
first on the ground."
His huge sword went flying from his hand.
"Slowly, ponderously, he rolled onto his 
back."
"The Dornishman flung away his ruined shield, grasped the spear in both hands, and sauntered away."
"Behind him the Mountain let out a groan, and pushed himself onto an elbow."
"Oberyn whirled cat-quick, 
and ran at his fallen foe."
"""EEEEELLLLLLIIIIIAAAAA!"""
"he screamed, as he drove the spear down with 
the whole weight of his body behind it."
"The crack of the ashwood shaft snapping was almost as sweet a 
sound as Cersei's wail of fury, and for an instant Prince Oberyn had wings."
"The snake has vaulted over 
the Mountain."
"Four feet of broken spear jutted from Clegane's belly as Prince Oberyn rolled, rose, and 
dusted himself off."
He tossed aside the splintered spear and claimed his foe's greatsword.
"""If you die 
before you say her name, ser, I will hunt you through all seven hells,"" he promised."
"Ser Gregor tried to rise, The broken spear had gone through him, and was pinning him to the ground."
"He 
wrapped both hands about the shaft, grunting, but could not pull it out."
"Beneath him was a spreading pool 
of red."
"""I am feeling more innocent by the instant,"" Tyrion told Ellaria Sand beside him."
Prince Oberyn moved closer.
"""Say the name!"""
"He put a foot on the Mountain's chest and raised the 
greatsword with both hands."
"Whether he intended to hack off Gregor's head or shove the point through 
his eyeslit was something Tyrion would never know."
Clegane's hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee.
"The Red Viper brought down the 
greatsword in a wild slash, but he was off-balance, and the edge did no more than put another dent in the 
Mountain's vambrace."
"Then the sword was forgotten as Gregor's hand tightened and twisted, yanking the 
Dornishman down on top of him."
"They wrestled in the dust and blood, the broken spear wobbling back 
Page 635

and forth."
"Tyrion saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince, 
drawing him tight against his chest, like a lover."
"""Elia of Dorne,"" they all heard Ser Gregor say, when they were close enough to kiss."
"His deep voice 
boomed within the helm."
"""I killed her screaming whelp."""
"He thrust his free hand into Oberyn's 
unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes."
"""Then I raped her."""
"Clegane 
slammed his fist into the Dornishman's mouth, making splinters of his teeth."
"""Then I smashed her fucking 
head in."
"Like this."""
"As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold 
dawn air."
There was a sickening crunch.
"Ellaria Sand wailed in terror, and Tyrion's breakfast came 
boiling back up."
"He found himself on his knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes, and that 
double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers."
He never heard his father speak the words that condemned him.
Perhaps no words were necessary.
"I 
put my life in the Red Viper's hands, and he dropped it."
"When he remembered, too late, that snakes had 
no hands, Tyrion began to laugh hysterically."
"He was halfway down the serpentine steps before he realized that the gold cloaks were not taking him 
back to his tower room."
"""I've been consigned to the black cells,"" he said."
They did not bother to answer.
Why waste your breath on the dead?
"Chapter 71 
DAENERYS 
Dany broke her fast under the persimmon tree that grew in the terrace garden, watching her dragons 
chase each other about the apex of the Great Pyramid where the huge bronze harpy once stood."
"Meereen had a score of lesser pyramids, but none stood even half as tall."
"From here she could see the 
whole city: the narrow twisty alleys and wide brick streets, the temples and granaries, hovels and palaces, 
brothels and baths, gardens and fountains, the great red circles of the fighting pits."
"And beyond the walls 
was the pewter sea, the winding Skahazadhan, the dry brown hills, burnt orchards, and blackened fields."
"Up here in her garden Dany sometimes felt like a god, living atop the highest mountain in the world."
Do all gods feel so lonely?
"Some must, surely."
"Missandei had told her of the Lord of Harmony, 
worshiped by the Peaceful People of Naath; he was the only true god, her little scribe said, the god who 
always was and always would be, who made the moon and stars and earth, and all the creatures that 
dwelt upon them."
Poor Lord of Harmony.
Dany pitied him.
"it must be terrible to be alone for all time, 
attended by hordes of butterfly women you could make or unmake at a word."
"Westeros had seven gods 
at least, though Viserys had told her that some septons, said the seven were only aspects of a single god, 
seven facets of a single crystal."
That was just confusing.
"The red priests believed in two gods, she had 
heard, but two who were eternally at war."
Dany liked that even less.
"She would not want to be eternally 
at war."
"Missandei served her duck eggs and dog sausage, and half a cup of sweetened wine mixed with the 
juice of a lime."
"The honey drew flies, 
but a scented candle drove them off."
"The flies were not so troublesome up here as they were in the rest 
Page 636

of her city, she had found, something else she liked about the pyramid."
"""I must remember to do 
something about the flies,"" Dany said."
"""Are there many flies on Naath, Missandei?"""
"""On Naath there are butterflies,"" the scribe responded in the Common Tongue."
"""More wine?"""
"""No."
"I must hold court soon."""
Dany had grown very fond of Missandei.
"The little scribe with the big 
golden eyes was wise beyond her years."
She is brave as well.
"She had to be, to survive the life she's 
lived."
One day she hoped to see this fabled isle of Naath.
"Missandei said the Peaceful People made 
music instead of war."
"They did not kill, not even animals; they ate only fruit and never flesh."
"The butterfly 
spirits sacred to their Lord of Harmony protected their isle against those who would do them harm."
"Many conquerors had sailed on Naath to blood their swords, only to sicken and die."
"The butterflies do 
not help them when the slave ships come raiding, though."
"""I am going to take you home one day, 
Missandei,"" Dany promised."
"ff I had made the same promise to Jorah, would he still have sold me?"
"""I 
swear it."""
"""This one is content to stay with you, Your Grace."
"Naath will be there, always."
"You are good to this - to 
me."""
"""And you to me."""
Dany took the girl by the hand.
"""Come help me dress."""
Jhiqui helped Missandei bathe her while Irri was laying out her clothes.
"Today she wore a robe of purple 
samite and a silver sash, and on her head the three-headed dragon crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood 
had given her in Qarth."
"Her slippers were silver as well, with heels so high that she was always half afraid 
she was about to topple over."
"When she was dressed, Missandei brought her a polished silver glass so 
she could see how she looked."
Dany stared at herself in silence.
Is this the face of a conqueror?
"So far as 
she could tell, she still looked like a little girl."
"No one was calling her Daenerys the Conqueror yet, but perhaps they would."
"Aegon the Conqueror 
had won Westeros with three dragons, but she had taken Meereen with sewer rats and a wooden cock, 
in less than a day."
Poor Groleo.
"He still grieved for his ship, she knew."
"If a war galley could ram another 
ship, why not a gate?"
"That had been her thought when she commanded the captains to drive their ships 
ashore."
"Their masts had become her battering rams, and swarms of freedmen had torn their hulls apart to 
build mantlets, turtles, catapults, and ladders."
"The sellwords had given each ram a bawdy name, and it 
had been the mainmast of Meraxes - formerly Joso's Prank that had broken the eastern gate."
"Joso's 
Cock, they called it."
"The fighting had raged bitter and bloody for most of a day and well into the night 
before the wood began to splinter and Meraxes' iron figurehead, a laughing jester's face, came crashing 
through."
"Dany had wanted to lead the attack herself, but to a man her captains said that would be madness, and 
her captains never agreed on anything."
"Instead she remained in the rear, sitting atop her silver in a long 
shirt of mail."
"She heard the city fall from half a league away, though, when the defenders' shouts of 
defiance changed to cries of fear."
"Her dragons had roared as one in that moment, filling the night with 
flame."
"The slaves are rising, she knew at once."
My sewer rats have gnawed off their chains.
"When the last resistance had been crushed by the Unsullied and the sack had run its course, Dany 
entered her city."
"The dead were heaped so high before the broken gate that it took her freedmen near an 
hour to make a path for her silver."
"Joso's Cock and the great wooden turtle that had protected it, 
covered with horsehides, lay abandoned within."
"She rode past burned buildings and broken windows, 
through brick streets where the gutters were choked with the stiff and swollen dead."
"Cheering slaves 
lifted bloodstained hands to her as she went by, and called her ""Mother."""
"Page 637

In the plaza before the Great Pyramid, the Meereenese huddled forlorn."
"The Great Masters had looked 
anything but great in the morning light."
"Stripped of their jewels and their fringed tokars, they were 
contemptible; a herd of old men with shriveled balls and spotted skin and young men with ridiculous hair."
"Their women were either soft and fleshy or as dry as old sticks, their face paint streaked by tears."
"""I want 
your leaders,"" Dany told them."
"""Give them up, and the rest of you shall be spared."""
"""How many?"""
"one old woman had asked, sobbing."
"""How many must you have to spare us?"""
"""One hundred and sixty-three,"" she answered."
"She had them nailed to wooden posts around the plaza, each man pointing at the next."
"The anger was 
fierce and hot inside her when she gave the command; it made her feel like an avenging dragon."
"But later, 
when she passed the men dying on the posts, when she heard their moans and smelled their bowels and 
blood ... 
Dany put the glass aside, frowning."
It was just.
It was.
I did it for the children.
"Her audience chamber was on the level below, an echoing highceilinged room with walls of purple 
marble."
It was a chilly place for all its grandeur.
"There had been a throne there, a fantastic thing of carved 
and gilded wood in the shape of a savage harpy."
"She had taken one long look and commanded it be 
broken up for firewood."
"""I will not sit in the harpy's lap,"" she told them."
"Instead she sat upon a simple 
ebony bench."
"it served, though she had heard the Meereenese muttering that it did not befit a queen."
Her bloodriders were waiting for her.
"Silver bells tinkled in their oiled braids, and they wore the gold and 
jewels of dead men."
"Meereen had been 
rich beyond imagining."
"Even her sellswords seemed sated, at least for now."
"Across the room, Grey 
Worm wore the plain uniform of the Unsullied, his spiked bronze cap beneath one arm."
"These at least she 
could rely on, or so she hoped ... and Brown Ben Plumm as well, solid Ben with his grey-white hair and 
weathered face, so beloved of her dragons."
"And Daario beside him, glittering in gold."
"Daario and Ben 
Plumm, Grey Worm, Irri, Jhiqui, Missandei ... as she looked at them Dany found herself wondering 
which of them would betray her next."
The dragon has three heads.
"There are two men in the world who I can trust, if I can flnd them."
"I will not 
be alone then."
"We will be three against the world, like Aegon and his sisters."
"""Was the night as quiet as it seemed?"""
Dany asked.
"""It seems it was, Your Grace,"" said Brown Ben Plumm."
She was pleased.
"Meereen had been sacked savagely, as new-fallen cities always were, but Dany was 
determined that should end now that the city was hers."
"She had decreed that murderers were to be 
hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists their manhood."
"Eight killers swung from the walls, 
and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms, but Meereen was 
calm again."
But for how long?
A fly buzzed her head.
"Dany waved it off, irritated, but it returned almost at once."
"""There are too many 
flies in this city."""
Ben Plumm gave a bark of laughter.
"""There were flies in my ale this morning."
"I swallowed one of them."""
"Page 638

""Flies are the dead man's revenge."""
"Daario smiled, and stroked the center prong of his beard."
"""Corpses 
breed maggots, and maggots breed flies."""
"""We will rid ourselves of the corpses, then."
Starting with those in the plaza below.
"Grey Worm, will you 
see to it?"""
"""The queen commands, these ones obey."""
"""Best bring sacks as well as shovels, Worm,"" Brown Ben counseled."
"""Well past ripe, those ones."
"Falling 
off those poles in bits and pieces, and crawling with ."
.
". """
"""He knows."
"So do L"" Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen the Plaza of 
Punishment in Astapor."
"I made a horror just as great, but surely they deserved it."
"Harsh justice is still 
justice."
"""Your Grace,"" said Missandei, ""Ghiscari inter their honored dead in crypts below their manses."
"if you 
would boil the bones clean and return them to their kin, it would be a kindness."""
The widows will curse me all the same.
"""Let it be done."""
Dany beckoned to Daario.
"""How many seek 
audience this morning?"""
"""Two have presented themselves to bask in your radiance."""
"Daario had plundered himself a whole new wardrobe in Meereen, and 
to match it he had redyed his trident beard and curly hair a deep rich purple."
"It made his eyes look 
almost purple too, as if he were some lost Valyrian."
"""They arrived in the night on the Indigo Star, a 
trading galley out of Qarth."""
"A slaver, you mean."
Dany frowned.
"""Who are they?"""
"""The Star's master and one who claims to speak for Astapor."""
"""I will see the envoy first."""
"He proved to be a pale ferret-faced man with ropes of pearls and spun gold hanging heavy about his 
neck."
"""Your Worship!"""
he cried.
"""My name is Ghael."
"I bring greetings to the Mother of Dragons from 
King Cleon of Astapor, Cleon the Great."""
Dany stiffened.
"""I left a council to rule Astapor."
"A healer, a scholar, and a priest."""
"""Your Worship, those sly rogues betrayed your trust."
"It was revealed that they were scheming to restore 
the Good Masters to power and the people to chains."
"Great Cleon exposed their plots and hacked their 
heads off with a cleaver, and the grateful folk of Astapor have crowned him for his valor."""
"""Noble Ghael,"" said Missandei, in the dialect of Astapor, ""is this the same Cleon once owned by 
Grazdan mo Ullhor?"""
"Her voice was guileless, yet the question plainly made the envoy anxious."
"""The same,"" he admitted."
"""A 
great man."""
"Page 639

Missandei leaned close to Dany."
"""He was a butcher in Grazdan's kitchen,"" the girl whispered in her ear."
"""It was said he could slaughter a pig faster than any man in Astapor."""
I have given Astapor a butcher king.
"Dany felt ill, but she knew she must not let the envoy see it."
"""I will 
pray that King Cleon rules well and wisely."
"What would he have of me?"""
Ghael rubbed his mouth.
"""Perhaps we should speak more privily, Your Grace?"""
"""I have no secrets from my captains and commanders."""
"""As you wish."
Great Cleon bids me declare his devotion to the Mother of Dragons.
"Your enemies are 
his enemies, he says, and chief among them are the Wise Masters of Yunkai."
"He proposes a pact 
between Astapor and Meereen, against the Yunkai'i."""
"""I swore no harm would come to Yunkai if they released their slaves,"" said Dany."
"""These Yunkish dogs cannot be trusted, Your Worship."
Even now they plot against you.
"New levies 
have been raised and can be seen drilling outside the city walls, warships are being built, envoys have 
been sent to New Ghis and Volantis in the west, to make alliances and hire sellswords."
"They have even 
dispatched riders to Vaes Dothrak to bring a khalasar down upon you."
"Great Cleon bid me tell you not 
to be afraid."
Astapor remembers.
Astapor will not forsake you.
"To prove his faith, Great Cleon offers to seal your 
alliance with a marriage."""
"""A marriage?"
"To me?"""
Ghael smiled.
His teeth were brown and rotten.
"""Great Cleon will give you many strong sons."""
"Dany found herself bereft of words, but little Missandei came to her rescue."
"""Did his first wife give him 
sons?"""
The envoy looked at her unhappily.
"""Great Cleon has three daughters by his first wife."
"Two of his newer 
wives are with child."
"But he means to put all of them aside if the Mother of Dragons will consent to wed 
him."""
"""How noble of him,"" said Dany."
"""I will consider all you've said, my lord."""
"She gave orders that Ghael be 
given chambers for the night, somewhere lower in the pyramid."
"All my victories turn to dross in my hands, she thought."
"Whatever I do, all I make is death and horror."
"When word of what had befallen Astapor reached the streets, as it surely would, tens of thousands of 
newly freed Meereenese slaves would doubtless decide to follow her when she went west, for fear of 
what awaited them if they stayed ... yetit might well be that worse would await them on the march."
"Even 
if she emptied every granary in the city and left Meereen to starve, how could she feed so many?"
"The 
way before her was fraught with hardship, bloodshed, and danger."
Ser Jorah had warned her of that.
"He'd warned her of so many things ... he'd ... No, I will not think of forah Mormont."
"Let him keep a little 
longer."
"""I shall see this trader captain,"" she announced."
Perhaps he would have some better tidings.
That proved to be a forlorn hope.
"The master of the Indigo Star was Qartheen, so he wept copiously 
when asked about Astapor."
"""The city bleeds."
"Dead men rot unburied in the streets, each pyramid is an 
armed camp, and the markets have neither food nor slaves for sale."
And the poor children!
"King 
Page 640

Cleaver's thugs have seized every highborn boy in Astapor to make new Unsullied for the trade, though it 
will be years before they are trained."""
The thing that surprised Dany most was how unsurprised she was.
"She found herself remembering 
Eroeh, the Lhazarene girl she had once tried to protect, and what had happened to her."
"It will be the 
same in Meereen once I march, she thought."
"The slaves from the fighting pits, bred and trained to 
slaughter, were already proving themselves unruly and quarrelsome."
"They seemed to think they owned 
the city now, and every man and woman in it."
Two of them had been among the eight she'd hanged.
"There is no more I can do, she told herself."
"""What do you want of me, Captain?"""
"""Slaves,"" he said."
"""My holds are full to bursting with ivory, ambergris, 
zorse hides, and other fine goods."
"I would trade them here for slaves, to sell in Lys and Volantis.- 
""We have no slaves for sale,"" said Dany."
"""My queen?"""
Daario stepped forward.
"""The riverside is full of Meereenese, begging leave to be allowed 
to sell themselves to this Qartheen."
"They are thicker than the flies."""
Dany was shocked.
"""They want to be slaves?"""
"""The ones who come are well spoken and gently born, sweet queen."
Such slaves are prized.
"In the Free 
Cities they will be tutors, scribes, bed slaves, even healers and priests."
"They will sleep in soft beds, eat 
rich foods, and dwell in manses."
"Here they have lost all, and live in fear and squalor."""
"""I see."""
"Perhaps it was not so shocking, if these tales of Astapor were true."
Dany thought a moment.
"""Any man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do so."
"Or woman."""
She raised a hand.
"""But they 
may not sell their children, nor a man his wife."""
"""In Astapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed hands,"" Missandei told her."
"""We'll do the same,"" Dany decided."
Wars were won with gold as much as swords.
"""A tenth part."
"In gold 
or silver coin, or ivory."
"Meereen has no need of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides."""
"""It shall be done as you command, glorious queen,"" said Daario."
"""My Stormcrows will collect your 
tenth."""
"if the Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go astray, Dany knew."
"But the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as they were incorruptible."
"""Records must be kept,"" she said."
"""Seek among the freedmen for men who can read, write, and do 
sums."""
"His business done, the captain of the Indigo Star bowed and took his leave."
"Dany shifted uncomfortably 
on the ebony bench."
"She dreaded what must come next, yet she knew she had put it off too long already."
"Yunkai and Astapor, threats of war, marriage proposals, the march west looming over all ..."
"I need my 
knights."
"I need their swords, and I need their counsel."
"Yet the thought of seeing Jorah Mormont again 
made her feel as if she'd swallowed a spoonful of flies; angry, agitated, sick."
"She could almost feel them 
buzzing round her belly."
I am the blood of the dragon.
I must be strong.
"I must have flre in my eyes when 
I face them, not tears."
"""Tell Belwas to bring my knights,"" Dany commanded, before she could change her 
mind."
"""My good knights."""
"Page 641

Strong Belwas was puffing from the climb when he marched them through the doors, one meaty hand 
wrapped tight around each man's arm."
"Ser Barristan walked with his head held high, but Ser Jorah stared 
at the marble floor as he approached."
"The one is proud, the other guilty."
The old man had shaved off his white beard.
He looked ten years younger without it.
"But her balding 
bear looked older than he had."
They halted before the bench.
"Strong Belwas stepped back and stood 
with his arms crossed across his scarred chest."
Ser Jorah cleared his throat.
"""Khaleesi.."
"."""
"She had missed his voice so much, but she had to be stem."
"""Be quiet."
"I will tell you when to speak."""
"She 
stood."
"""When I sent you down into the sewers, part of me hoped I'd seen the last of you."
"It seemed a 
fitting end for liars, to drown in slavers' filth."
"I thought the gods would deal with you, but instead you 
returned to me."
"My gallant knights of Westeros, an informer and a tumcloak."
"My brother would have 
hanged you both."""
"Viserys, would have, anyway."
She did not know what Rhaegar would have done.
"""I 
will admit you helped win me this city..."" 
Ser Jorah's mouth tightened."
"""We won you this city."
"We sewer rats."""
"""Be quiet,"" she said again.. ."
though there was truth to what he said.
"While joso's Cock and the other 
rams were battering the city gates and her archers were firing flights of flaming arrows over the walls, 
Dany had sent two hundred men along the river under cover of darkness to fire the hulks in the harbor."
But that was only to hide their true purpose.
"As the flaming ships drew the eyes of the defenders on the 
walls, a few half-mad swimmers found the sewer mouths and pried loose a rusted iron grating."
"Ser Jorah, 
Ser Barristan, Strong Belwas, and twenty brave fools slipped beneath the brown water and up the brick 
tunnel, a mixed force of sellswords, Unsullied, and freedmen."
"Dany had told them to choose only men 
who had no families ... and preferably no sense of smell."
They had been lucky as well as brave.
"It had been a moon's turn since the last good rain, and the sewers 
were only thigh-high."
"The oilcloth they'd wrapped around their torches kept them dry, so they had light."
A few of the freedmen were frightened of the huge rats until Strong Belwas caught one and bit it in two.
"One man was killed by a great pale lizard that reared up out of the dark water to drag him off by the leg, 
but when next ripples were spied Ser Jorah butchered the beast with his blade."
"They took some wrong 
turnings, but once they found the surface Strong Belwas led them to the nearest fighting pit, where they 
surprised a few guards and struck the chains off the slaves."
"Within an hour, half the fighting slaves in 
Meereen had risen."
"""You helped win this city,"" she repeated stubbornly."
"""And you have served me well in the past."
"Ser 
Barristan saved me from the Titan's Bastard, and from the Sorrowful Man in Qarth."
"Ser Jorah saved me 
from the poisoner in Vaes Dothrak, and again from Drogo's bloodriders after my sun-and-stars had 
died."""
"So many people wanted her dead, sometimes she lost count."
"""And yet you lied, deceived me, 
betrayed me."""
She turned to Ser Barristan.
"""You protected my father for many years, fought beside 
my brother on the Trident, but you abandoned Viserys in his exile and bent your knee to the Usurper 
instead."
Why?
"And tell it true."""
"""Some truths are hard to hear."
"Robert was a ... a good knight ... chivalrous, brave ... he spared my life, 
and the lives of many others ..."
"Prince Viserys was only a boy, it would have been years before he was fit 
to rule, and ... forgive me, my queen, but you asked for truth."
.
.
"even as a child, your brother Viserys oft 
seemed to be his father's son, in ways that Rhaegar never did."""
"""His father's son?"""
Dany frowned.
"""What does that mean?"""
"Page 642

The old knight did not blink."
"""Your father is called 'the Mad King' in Westeros."
"Has no one ever told 
you?"""
"""Viserys did."""
The Mad King.
"""The Usurper called him that, the Usurper and his dogs."""
The Mad King.
"""It was a lie."""
"""Why ask for truth,"" Ser Barristan said softly, ""if you close your ears to it?"""
"He hesitated, then continued."
"""I told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that Id joined you."

less than half of it, Your Grace."
"The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my

Dany bristled.

"But every 
child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness."
Your father was not the first.
King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin.
"Every time a 
new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how 
it will land."""
Jaehaerys.
This old man knew my grandfather.
The thought gave her pause.
"Most of what she knew of 
Westeros had come from her brother, and the rest from Ser Jorah."
"Ser Barristan would have forgotten 
more than the two of them had ever known."
This man can tell me what I came from.
"""So I am a coin in 
the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?"""
"""No,"" Ser Barristan replied."
"""You are the trueborn heir of Westeros."
"To the end of my days I shall 
remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again."
"If not, I am content to serve 
Strong Belwas as his squire."""
"""What if I decide you're only worthy to be my fool?"""
Dany asked scornfully.
"""Or perhaps my cook?"""
"""I would be honored, Your Grace,"" Selmy said with quiet dignity."
"""I 
can bake apples and boil beef as well as any man, and I've roasted many a duck over a campfire."
"I hope 
you like them greasy, with charred skin and bloody bones."""
That made her smile.
"""I'd have to be mad to eat such fare."
"Ben Plumm, come give Ser Barristan your 
longsword."""
But Whitebeard would not take it.
"""I flung my sword at Joffrey's feet and have not touched one since."
"Only from the hand of my queen will I accept a sword again."""
"""As you wish."""
Dany took the sword from Brown Ben and offered it hilt first.
"The old man took it 
reverently."
"""Now kneel,"" she told him, /land swear it to my service."""
He went to one knee and lay the blade before her as he said the words.
Dany scarcely heard them.
"He 
was the easy one, she thought."
The other will be harder.
"When Ser Barristan was done, she turned to 
Jorah Mormont."
"""And now you, ser."
"Tell me true."""
"Page 643

The big man's neck was red; whether from anger or shame she did not know."
"""I have tried to tell you 
true, half a hundred times."
I told you Arstan was more than he seemed.
"I warned you that Xaro and Pyat 
Pree were not to be trusted."
"I warned you - "" 
""You warned me against everyone except yourself."""
His insolence angered her.
He should be humbler.
He should beg for my forgiveness.
"""Trust no one but Jorah Mormont, you said ... and all the time you 
were the Spider's creature!"""
"""I am no man's creature."
"I took the eunuch's gold, yes."
"I learned some ciphers and wrote some letters, 
but that was all - "" 
""All?"
"You spied on me and sold me to my enemies!"""
"""For a time."""
He said it grudgingly.
"""I stopped."""
"""When?"
"When did you stop?"""
"""I made one report from Qarth, but - 
""From Qarth?"""
Dany had been hoping it had ended much earlier.
"""What did you write from Qarth?"
"That 
you were my man now, that you wanted no more of their schemes?"""
Ser Jorah could not meet her eyes.
"""When Khal Drogo died, you asked me to go with you to Yi Ti and the jade Sea."
"Was that your wish or 
Robert's?"""
"""That was to protect you,"" he insisted."
"""To keep you away from them."
I knew what snakes they were .
.
". """
"""Snakes?"
"And what are you, ser?"""
Something unspeakable occurred to her.
"""You told them I was 
carrying Drogo's child..."" 
""Khaleesi..."" 
""Do not think to deny it, ser,"" Ser Barristan said sharply."
"""I was there when the eunuch told the council, 
and Robert decreed that Her Grace and her child must die."
"You were the source, ser."
"There was even 
talk that you might do the deed, for a pardon."""
"""A lie."""
Ser Jorah's face darkened.
"""I would never ... Daenerys, it was me who stopped you from 
drinking the wine."""
"""Yes."
"And how was it you knew the wine was poisoned?"""
"""I ..."
"I but suspected ... the caravan brought a letter from Varys, he warned me there would be attempts."
"He wanted you watched, yes, but not harmed."""
He went to his knees.
"""If I had not told them someone 
else would have."
"You know that."""
"""I know you betrayed me."""
"She touched her belly, where her son Rhaego had perished."
"""I know a 
poisoner tried to kill my son, because of you."
"That's what I know"" 
""No ..."
"no."""
He shook his head.
"""I never meant ... forgive me."
"You have to forgive me."""
"Page 644

""Have to?"""
It was too late.
He should have begun by begging forgiveness.
"She could not pardon him as 
she'd intended."
She had dragged the wineseller behind her horse until there was nothing left of him.
"Didn't 
the man who brought him deserve the same?"
"This is Jorah, my fierce bear, the right arm that never failed 
me."
"I would be dead without him, but ."
.
.
"""I can't forgive you,"" she said."
"""I can't."""
"""You forgave the old man..."" 
""He lied to me about his name."
"You sold my secrets to the men who killed my father and stole my 
brother's throne."""
"""I protected you."
I fought for you.
"Killed for you."""
"Kissed me, she thought, betrayed me."
"""I went down into the sewers like a rat."
"For you."""
It might have been kinder if you'd died there.
Dany said nothing.
There was nothing to say.
"""Daenerys,"" he said, ""I have loved you."""
And there it was.
Three treasons will you know Once for blood and once for gold and once for love.
"""The gods do nothing without a purpose, they say."
"You did not die in battle, so it must be they still have 
some use for you."
But I don't.
I will not have you near me.
"You are banished, ser."
"Go back to your 
masters in King's Landing and collect your pardon, if you can."
Or to Astapor.
"No doubt the butcher king 
needs knights."""
"""No."""
He reached for her.
"""Daenerys, please, hear me..."" 
She slapped his hand away."
"""Do not ever presume to touch me again, or to speak my name."
"You have 
until dawn to collect your things and leave this city."
"If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I will 
have Strong Belwas twist your head off."
I will.
"Believe that."""
"She turned her back on him, her skirts 
swirling."
I cannot bear to see his face.
"""Remove this liar from my sight, "" she commanded."
"I must not 
weep."
I must not.
If I weep I will forgive him.
"Strong Belwas seized Ser Jorah by the arm and dragged 
him out."
"When Dany glanced back, the knight was walking as if drunk, stumbling and slow."
"She looked 
away until she heard the doors open and 
close."
Then she sank back onto the ebony bench.
"He's gone, then."
"Myfather and my mother, my 
brothers, Ser Willem Darry, Drogo who was my sunand-stars, his son who died inside me, and now Ser 
forah ... 
""The queen has a good heart,"" Daario purred through his deep purple whiskers, ""but that one is more 
dangerous than all the Oznaks and Meros rolled up in one."""
"His strong hands caressed the hilts of his 
matched blades, those wanton golden women."
"""You need not even say the word, my radiance."
"Only give 
the tiniest nod, and your Daario shall fetch you back his ugly head."""
"""Leave him be."
The scales are balanced now.
"Let him go home."""
"Dany pictured Jorah moving amongst 
old gnarled oaks and tall pines, past flowering thornbushes, grey stones bearded with moss, and little 
creeks running icy down steep hillsides."
"She saw him entering a hall built of huge logs, where dogs slept 
by the hearth and the smell of meat and mead hung thick in the smoky air."
"""We are done for now,"" she 
told her captains."
"Page 645

it was all she could do not to run back up the wide marble stairs."
"Irri helped her slip from her court 
clothes and into more comfortable garb; baggy woolen breeches, a loose felted tunic, a painted Dothraki 
vest."
"""You are trembling, Khaleesi,"" the girl said as she knelt to lace up Dany's sandals."
"""I'm cold,"" Dany lied."
"""Bring me the book I was reading last night."""
"She wanted to lose herself in the 
words, in other times and other places."
"The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from 
the Seven Kingdoms."
"Children's stories, if truth be told; too simple and fanciful to be true history."
"All the 
heroes were tall and handsome, and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes."
"Yet she loved them all 
the same."
"Last night she had been reading of the three princesses in the red tower, locked away by the 
king for the crime of being beautiful."
"When her handmaid brought the book, Dany had no trouble finding the page where she had left off, but 
it was no good."
She found herself reading the same passage half a dozen times.
"Ser forah gave me this 
book as a bride's gift, the day I wed Khal Drogo."
"But Daario is right, I shouldn't have banished him."
"I 
should have kept him, or I should have killed him."
"She played at being a queen, yet sometimes she still 
felt like a scared little girl."
Viserys always said what a dolt I was.
Was he truly mad?
"She closed the 
book."
"She could still recall Ser Jorah, if she wished."
Or send Daario to kill him.
"Dany fled from the choice, out onto the terrace."
"She found Rhaegal asleep beside the pool, a green and 
bronze coil basking in the sun."
"Drogon was perched up atop the pyramid, in the place where the huge 
bronze harpy had stood before she had commanded it to be pulled down."
"He spread his wings and 
roared when he spied her."
"There was no sign of Viserion, but when she went to the parapet and scanned 
the horizon she 
saw pale wings in the far distance, sweeping above the river."
He is hunting.
They grow bolder every day.
Yet it still made her anxious when they flew too far away.
"One day one of them may not return, she 
thought."
"""Your Grace?"""
She turned to find Ser Barristan behind her.
"""What more would you have of me, ser?"
"I spared you, I 
took you into my service, now give me some peace."""
"""Forgive me, Your Grace."
It was only .
.
.
"now that you know who I am..."" The old man hesitated."
"""A 
knight of the Kingsguard is in the king's presence day and night."
"For that reason, our vows require us to 
protect his secrets as we would his life."
"But your father's secrets by rights belong to you now, along with 
his throne, and ..."
"I thought perhaps you might have questions for me."""
Questions?
"She had a hundred questions, a thousand, ten thousand."
Why couldn't she think of one?
"""Was my father truly mad?"""
she blurted out.
Why do I ask that?
"""Viserys said this talk of madness was a 
ploy of the Usurper's..."" 
""Viserys was a child, and the queen sheltered him as much as she could."
"Your father always had a little 
madness in him, I now believe."
"Yet he was charming and generous as well, so his lapses were forgiven."
"His reign began with such promise ... but as the years passed, the lapses grew more frequent, until."
".."" 
Dany stopped him."
"""Do I want to hear this now?"""
Ser Barristan considered a moment.
"""Perhaps not."
"Not now."""
"""Not now,"" she agreed."
"""One day."
One day you must tell me all.
The good and the bad.
"There is some 
Page 646

good to be said of my father, surely?"""
"""There is, Your Grace."
"Of him, and those who came before him."
"Your grandfather Jaehaerys and his 
brother, their father Aegon, your mother ... and Rhaegar."
"Him most of all."""
"""I wish I could have known him."""
Her voice was wistful.
"""I wish he could have known you,"" the old knight said."
"""When you are ready, I will tell you all."""
Dany kissed him on the cheek and sent him on his way.
"That night her handmaids brought her lamb, with a salad of raisins and carrots soaked in wine, and a hot 
flaky bread dripping with honey."
She could eat none of it.
Did Rhaegar ever grow so weary?
"she 
wondered."
"Did Aegon, after his conquest?"
"Later, when the time came for sleep, Dany took Irri into bed with her, for the first time since the ship."
"But even as she shuddered in release and wound her fingers through her handmaid's thick black hair, she 
pretended it was Drogo holding her ... only somehow his face kept turning into Daario's."
"If I want Daario 
I need only say so."
She lay with Irri's legs entangled in her own.
"His eyes looked almost purple today... 
Dany's dreams were dark that night, and she woke three times from half-remembered nightmares."
"After 
the third time she was too restless to return to sleep."
"Moonlight streamed through the slanting windows, 
silvering the marble floors."
A cool breeze was blowing through the open terrace doors.
"Irri slept soundly 
beside her, her lips slightly parted, one dark brown nipple peeping out above the sleeping silks."
"For a 
moment Dany was tempted, but it was Drogo she wanted, or perhaps Daario."
Not Irri.
"The maid was 
sweet and skillful, but all her kisses tasted of duty."
"She rose, leaving Irri asleep in the moonlight."
Jhiqui and Missandei slept in their own beds.
"Dany slipped 
on a robe and padded barefoot across the marble floor, out onto the terrace."
"The air was chilly, but she 
liked the feel of grass between her toes and the sound of the leaves whispering to one another."
"Wind 
ripples chased each other across the surface of the little bathing pool and made the moon's reflection 
dance and shimmer."
She leaned against a low brick parapet to look down upon the city.
Meereen was sleeping too.
"Lost in 
dreams of kinder days, perhaps."
"Night covered the streets like a black blanket, hiding the corpses and 
the grey rats that came up from the sewers to feast on them, the swarms of stinging flies."
"Distant torches 
glimmered red and yellow where her sentries walked their rounds, and here and there she saw the faint 
glow of lanterns bobbing down an alley."
"Perhaps one was Ser Jorah, leading his horse slowly toward the 
gate."
"Farewell, old bear."
"Farewell, betrayer."
"She was Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, khaleesi and queen, Mother of Dragons, slayer of 
warlocks, breaker of chains, and there was no one in the world that she could trust."
"""Your Grace?"""
"Missandei stood at her elbow wrapped in a bedrobe, wooden sandals on her feet."
"""I 
woke, and saw that you were gone."
Did you sleep well?
"What are you looking at?"""
"""My city,"" said Dany."
"""I was looking for a house with a red door, but by night all the doors are black."""
"""A red door?"""
Missandei was puzzled.
"""What house is this?"""
"""No house."
"It does not matter."""
Dany took the younger girl by the hand.
"""Never lie to me, Missandei."
